N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses significant challenges due to its high mortality, making it a critical area of research. This retrospective observational study aimed to analyze real-world data from comprehensive genome profiling (CGP) of Japanese patients with PDAC, mainly focusing on differences in gene detection rates among panels and the implications for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. This study enrolled 2568 patients with PDAC who had undergone CGP between June 2019 and December 2021 using data from the nationwide Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics database. Two types of CGP assays (tissue and liquid biopsies) were compared and a higher detection rate of genetic abnormalities in tissue specimens was revealed. HRD-related gene alterations were detected in 23% of patients, with BRCA1/2 mutations accounting for 0.9% and 2.9% of patients, respectively. Treatment outcome analysis indicated that patients with BRCA1/2 mutations had a longer time to treatment discontinuation with FOLFIRINOX than gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy (9.3 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.028). However, no significant differences were observed in the treatment response among the other HRD-related genes. Logistic regression analysis identified younger age and family history of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers as predictive factors for HRD-related gene alterations. Despite the lack of progression-free survival data and the inability to discriminate between germline and somatic mutations, this study provides valuable insights into the clinical implications of CGP in Japanese patients with PDAC. Further research is warranted to optimize panel selection and elucidate the efficacy of platinum-based therapies depending on the HRD status.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  -  Background: Brenetafusp (brene), an ImmTAC bispecific T cell engager (PRAME x CD3), showed robust disease control and tumor reduction in Ph1 (NCT04262466; Hamid 2022, Hamid 2024) in HLA-A*02:01+ patients (pts). We present monotherapy (mono) and chemotherapy combination (CC) data in PROC, and association with a baseline blood T cell fitness (TCF) signature that was also linked with tebentafusp benefit in uveal melanoma (ESMO 2024). Preclinically, chemo increased antigen presentation and ImmTAC activity (ESMO 2024). Method(s): Brene was dosed IV weekly with step-up to target dose of 40-320 mcg in mono escalation or 160 mcg in expansion & in CC. Chemo options were gemcitabine (Gem), nab-paclitaxel (NP), and PLD. Primary objectives: Safety, dose selection, and efficacy (RECIST v1.1). Exploratory endpoints included molecular response (>= 0.5 log ctDNA reduction by week 9) and TCF (mean RNAseq expression of TESPA1, CD28 and GRP183 in blood at baseline). Data cutoff: Mar 2024. Result(s): 47 pts with high-grade serous PROC received brene (mono 32, CC 15) at active doses in escalation and expansion. Pts had a median 4 prior regimens. Most common adverse event (AE) was Grade 1/2 cytokine release syndrome (mono 53%, CC 80%). No drug-related AE led to treatment discontinuation or death. CC safety was consistent with individual agents. 40 pts were efficacy evaluable (mono 28, CC 12). Mono disease control rate (DCR; PR+SD) was 61% (17/28) with 2 PR (ORR 7%); mPFS was 3.3 mo and 6-mo OS rate was 73%...Copyright © 2024

N2  -  Background: Platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer (PROC) has poor prognosis with limited treatment options. The BRIGHT trial (NCT05044871) aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of biomarker-driven targeted combinatorial therapies of pamiparib (Pami, a PARP inhibitor), tislelizumab (TIS, a PD-1 inhibitor), bevacizumab (BEV), and nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) in pts with PROC. Here, we report the primary analysis results. Method(s): Pts with PROC were assigned based on their BRCA mutation status and CD8+ TILs count to receive Pami + BEV (Arm 1, BRCAm; N=40), TIS + BEV + nab-PTX (Arm 2, BRCAwt and CD8+ TILs >=3; part 1 [N=50], part 2 [N=20]), or BEV + nab-PTX (Arm 3, BRCAwt and CD8+ TILs <3; N=50). The Bayesian method was used to update ORR observed in part 1 of Arm 2. Primary endpoints were ORRs of each arm, and ORR in part 1 of Arm 2. Result(s): 105 pts were enrolled and assigned to Arm 1 (N=29), Arm 2 (N=70), and Arm 3 (N=6). Most pts with BRCAwt tumors (92.1%; 70/76) had positive CD8+ TILs (>=3). ORRs in each arm were 23.1%, 41.5%, and 60.0%, respectively (Table); ORR in part 1 of Arm 2 was 46.0% (95% CI 31.8-60.7). Pts with higher CD8+ TILs tended to have higher ORR in Arm 2 (CD8+ TILs >=12, 50.0% [24/48]; CD8+ TILs >=3 - <12, 17.6% [3/17]). With a median follow-up of 7.4 mo (data cut-off, March 20, 2024), the median PFS in each arm was 4.1, 7.3, and 11.7 mo, respectively. Grade >=3 TRAEs occurred in 24.1%, 48.6%, and 33.3% of pts; SAEs occurred in 13.8%, 21.4%, and 16.7% of pts, respectively. In Arm 2, four (5.7%) pts experienced grade >=3 irAEs. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): These findings highlight the potential clinical benefits of biomarker-driven targeted therapies in pts with PROC. The majority of pts in this study had BRCAwt tumors with positive CD8+ TILs (>=3), and PD-1 inhibitor-based combinatorial regimen (TIS + BEV + nab-PTX) resulted in notable ORR and PFS in this patient population.

N2  -  Background: Despite the success of cancer immunotherapy there are still tumor types in need of novel approaches. LOAd703 is an oncolytic adenovirus serotype 5/35 expressing the immunostimulatory transgenes trimerized membrane-bound CD40L and 4-1BBL. Safety and efficacy of LOAd703 and concomitant chemotherapy were evaluated in an open-label bi-center phase I/II clinical trial. Method(s): Patients were treated bi-weekly with maximum eight ultrasound-guided intratumoral injections of LOAd703 combined with either standard of care chemotherapy or conditioning gemcitabine. Increasing doses of LOAd703 (5x1010 viral particles: VP, 1x1011 VP and 5x1011 VP) were evaluated in phase I according to a standard 3+3 design. Tolerability of the highest dose in phase I was confirmed in phase Iia. Phase Iib was conducted to compare the highest dose levels. Result(s): 41 patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 29), colorectal cancer (n = 5), ovarian cancer (n = 4) and biliary cancer (n = 3) were included. The number of previous treatment lines varied between 0 and 5. 63% received LOAd703 with standard of care chemotherapy and the remaining 37% received conditioning gemcitabine. 22% experienced clinical benefit with partial response (n = 6) or long-lasting stable disease (>= 5 months, n = 3). All patients who experienced partial response had pancreatic cancer and received LOAd703 combined with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. This subset of patients showed a response rate of 32% and a median survival of 7.3 months. Two patients treated with LOAd703 and conditioning gemcitabine experienced long-lasting stable disease. Adverse events associated with LOAd703 and related procedures were overall transient and of grade 1-2. The most frequent adverse events were pyrexia (76%), chills (39%), and fatigue (34%). However, three patients developed nephrotoxicity possibly related to LOAd703. There was no correlation between serum anti-adenovirus IgG antibodies, which increased in all patients, and clinical benefit. Immune responses are under evaluation and will be presented at the meeting. Conclusion(s): Indication of clinical benefit in a subset of patients combined with tolerability warrant further investigation of LOAd703. Clinical trial identification: NCT03225989.

N2  -  SESSION TITLE: Diffuse Lung Disease Case Reports Posters (E) SESSION TYPE: Case Report Posters PRESENTED ON: 10/07/2024 12:30 pm - 01:15 pm INTRODUCTION: Gemcitabine is pyrimidine nucleoside antimetabolite approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, breast, bladder, and ovarian cancers. (1) The cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine are mediated through incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA with the assistance of dFdCDP, which inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis. (1) It typically has a low toxicity profile, with myelosuppression being the most common adverse effect. (2) CASE PRESENTATION: 77-year-old female with past medical history of recently diagnosed pancreatic adenocarcinoma T2N0M0 currently on treatment with gemcitabine and Abraxane on cycle 2 day 15, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic sinusitis, ITP status post splenectomy, and Sjogren's syndrome who was seen in the oncology office with shortness of breath and dry cough that started 3-4 days prior and had progressively gotten worse. She was also complaining of dyspnea on exertion. Her oxygen saturation was noted to be in the low 90s and she was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. The patient was afebrile on presentation to the emergency department with an oxygen saturation of 90%. She was placed on 2L nasal cannula, and her oxygen saturation improved to 96%. computed tomography angiography was ordered for concerns of a pulmonary embolism given her active malignancy, which did not show any evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism but did show bilateral multifocal ground-glass airspace opacities throughout the parenchyma. Lab work was significant for a white blood cell count of 76.3; however, she had recently undergone treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) and had an exaggerated response. She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, and showed no response, continuing to require supplemental oxygen. The decision was made to start her on high-dose Solu-Medrol and her symptoms progressively improved. DISCUSSION: While dyspnea can occur in up to 25% of patients on gemcitabine, pulmonary toxicity is relatively rare with a rate of 0-5%. (3) An increased risk of pulmonary toxicity was found in patients with previous lung disease, as well as patients with previous thoracic irradiation and in combination chemotherapy with drugs known to cause lung injury. The mechanism of pulmonary toxicity from gemcitabine is unknown; however, the working theory is that it is due to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to dysregulation of tissue repair. Literature review suggests most patients develop symptoms after their second cycle of gemcitabine. The most common presentation is dyspnea, followed by fever and findings of bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging. Diagnosis of gemcitabine-induced pulmonary toxicity is primarily made by clinical picture and radiological evidence showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Because the pattern of lung injury shares common clinical characteristics with other common lung pathologies such as pneumonia and pulmonary edema, it is important to keep on the differential for patients currently receiving treatment with gemcitabine. CONCLUSION(S): Although Gemcitabine can be extremely effective in treating solid tumors and is usually well tolerated, it is important to keep lung toxicity on the differential when patients present with shortness of breath, especially when imaging shows bilateral infiltrates. High dose steroids should always be considered early on in the treatment course. REFERENCE #1: Plunkett W, Huang P, Xu YZ, Heinemann V, Grunewald R, Gandhi V.

N2  -  Purpose: Overexpression of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 7 (CDK7) is linked to poor clinical outcomes in a variety of cancer types including AML, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancers. CDK7 plays a dual role in tumor progression by regulating the cell cycle via phosphorylation of members of the CDK family and stimulation of transcription via phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II. CDK7 has also been shown to be associated with super-enhancers which can lead to overexpression of oncogenic driver genes such as BCL2, GFI1, and MYC. The development of a selective inhibitor of CDK7 is a promising strategy to control expression of these oncogenic genes in patients' tumors. Previously, we described the design and synthesis of a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK7, TGN-1062, which was designed to bind to the catalytic ATP pocket. We showed efficacy in both AML and ovarian in vitro and in vivo models with correlative biomarker data. Here, we have generated further data on the effect and safety of TGN-1062 in pancreatic cancer cell line (CDX) and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models, both as a single agent and in combination with standard of care (SOC) therapies. Method(s): In vivo efficacy studies were conducted in mice engrafted with pancreatic CDX and PDX tumors and treated with TGN-1062 with and without SOC therapies. Tumors were measured to determine tumor growth inhibition (TGI) and correlating drug accumulation levels were measured in both tumors and plasma using mass spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on tumors to determine changes in cleaved Caspase-3, MYC, Ki67, and RNA Pol II. Rats were dosed with TGN-1062 to assess plasma exposures and preliminary tolerability. Result(s): In a pancreatic CDX model (MIA PaCa-2), TGN-1062 showed 38% TGI as a single agent and 121% TGI when in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, which on its own showed 37% TGI. In a pancreatic PDX model, TGN-1062 did not exhibit single agent effect, but combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel showed 95% TGI compared to 79% TGI with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel alone. Drug accumulation, biomarker analysis, and IHC from CDX and PDX tumors, showed that TGN-1062 treatment decreased RNA Pol II phosphorylation and MYC expression, and induced apoptosis. Rat pharmacokinetics indicated 100% oral bioavailability. Conclusion(s): Our potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK7, TGN-1062, shows promise in pancreatic cancer models as a single or in combination with SOC. Preliminary data suggests that TGN-1062 can be developed further in multiple cancer indications.

N2  -  Background: Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare pancreatic neoplasm. Recently, molecular analysis revealed that PACC shows a high frequency of the BRCA1/2 mutation and is likely to be considered a cancer associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Hereditary cancers, including HBOC, are characterized by multifocal and/or metachronous tumors. However, no case reports exist of germline BRCA1-mutated synchronous and metachronous PACC. Case: A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with synchronous and metachronous PACC at the age of 56 and underwent two surgeries. Ten months after the second surgery, the patient developed multiple liver metastases. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel therapy was administered as first-line chemotherapy. After seven cycles, computed tomography examination revealed progressive disease (PD). Therefore, modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) was administered as second- line chemotherapy. After 19 cycles of mFFX, comprehensive cancer genomic profiling (CGP) identified a BRCA1 pathogenic variant that was confirmed to be germline origin. Accordingly, we treated the patient with olaparib; however, he was diagnosed with PD after 4 months. He subsequently died 5 years and 9 months after the initial surgery, and 3 years and 10 months after chemotherapy. Based on the genetic data of the patients, his family members received genetic counseling followed by cascade testing. Consequently, the same gBRCA1 pathogenic variant was detected in the son and his surveillance for HBOC-related cancers was initiated. Conclusion(s): We diagnosed a 58-year-old man with a synchronous and metachronous PACC with germline BRCA1 pathogenic variant. Considering that PACC is likely to have BRCA1/2 mutations responsible for HBOC, we need to be aware of the possible presence of multifocal and/or metachronous tumors in patients with PACC. Additionally, patients with PACC should undergo genetic examinations, which would be beneficial in determining treatment strategies and health care for blood relatives.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  -  The goal of this study was to assess the safety of nab-paclitaxel in patients with ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer who had an allergic reaction to paclitaxel. We performed a retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer with an allergic reaction to paclitaxel who were subsequently treated with nab-paclitaxel at the Mayo Clinic Florida from January 2016 to June 2023. A total of 43 patients with ovarian cancer (31) or endometrial cancer (12) and a paclitaxel allergic reaction were identified. All patients were pre-medicated against allergic reactions prior to paclitaxel and subsequent nab-paclitaxel. Allergic reactions to paclitaxel were mild in fourteen patients (33%), moderate in twenty-five patients (58%) and severe in four (9%) patients. None of the 43 patients had an allergic reaction to subsequent nab-paclitaxel. Our data suggests that the administration of nab-paclitaxel to endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer patients with allergic reactions to paclitaxel is safe and should be considered a preferable treatment option in this clinical situation.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality among gynecologic cancers, primarily because it typically is diagnosed at a late stage and because of the development of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Improving outcomes in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is a substantial unmet need. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by cortisol has been shown to suppress the apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents, limiting their efficacy. Selective GR modulation may be able to counteract cortisol's antiapoptotic effects, enhancing chemotherapy's efficacy. A previous phase 2 study has shown that adding intermittently dosed relacorilant, a selective GR modulator, to nab-paclitaxel improved outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with minimal added toxicity, in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The ROSELLA study aims to confirm and expand on these findings in a larger population. Method(s): ROSELLA is a phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, global multicenter study in women with recurrent, platinum-resistant, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Eligible participants have received 1 to 3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including >=1 prior line of platinum therapy and prior treatment with bevacizumab, with documented progressive disease or intolerance to the most recent therapy. There is no biomarker-based requirement for participant selection. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive intermittently dosed relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS, investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks, and cancer antigen 125 response. The study is also evaluating safety and patient-reported outcomes.Copyright © 2024.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel is one of the first-line treatments for breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. However, its use is limited by the high frequency of hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of the current study was to assess clinical factors associated with immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel and characterize delayed hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel in patients with breast cancer. Method(s): We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who received paclitaxel (Taxol) or nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) between 1/1/2017 and 1/1/ 2022 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Result(s): In total, 12,274 patients were identified who were treated with paclitaxel. Of these, 6,165 had breast cancer and 1,233 were seen by a dermatologist. 734 patients (11.9%) developed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel. Age (p < 0.001), race (p < 0.001), and prior history of allergy based on prior ICD-10 code (p = 0.05) were significantly associated with immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Patients who developed an immediate HSR (mean 52.5 +/- 12.5 years versus 54.8 +/- 12.9 years) tended to be younger, on average, than those who did not experience a reaction. Compared to White patients, Black patients were 37% less likely (OR = 0.63; 95% 0.48 - 0.83) and Asian patients were 70% more likely (OR = 1.70; 95% 1.37 - 2.12) to experience a hypersensitivity reaction. 147 patients (4.0%) had a delayed hypersensitivity reaction (cutaneous rash). Delayed hypersensitivity reaction included toxic erythema of chemotherapy, urticaria, morbilliform, maculopapular, and pruritus phenotypes. The most common phenotypes were maculopapular (52%) and urticaria (36%). The majority had not been treated with nab-paclitaxel prior to rash (86%). Race (p<0.001) and history of allergy (p<0.001) were associated with development of a cutaneous reaction. Asian patients were almost twice as likely (OR = 1.99;95%CI: 1.51 - 2.61, P< 0.001) as White patients to present with a delayed HSR to paclitaxel. Patients with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction were more likely to develop a delayed cutaneous reaction (OR = 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.27-2.55) than those who did not get an immediate HSR, controlling for breast cancer stage and patient race. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, risk factors identified for development of immediate hypersensitivity reactions in this study were younger age, Asian race, and history of allergy. Patients who developed an immediate hypersensitivity reaction were more likely to develop a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Risk factors for development of the rash included Asian race and history of allergy. Awareness of these clinical factors which are associated with development of a rash could guide providers in choosing treatment with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  Background: Oncology therapeutic development has high failure rates with substantial costs. Advances in technology, including molecular characterisations of cancer and computational power, provide the opportunity to better model therapeutic response for existing and emerging therapies. Method(s): Concr adapted Bayesian statistical principles used by astrophysicists to effectively integrate multi-dimensional data (genomic & transcriptomic) for accurate modelling of cancer biology. Our proprietary computational framework was applied to predict clinical response and survival through construction of digital twins and in silico simulations of clinical trials. Predicted log odds ratios (LOR) were generated for drug response and compared to published data from 8 suitable historical clinical trials. Three distinct models underpin this framework: Drug Efficacy, Treatment Response & Overall Survival (OS). Three publicly available datasets were used for training: Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (in vitro dose-response data), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia and TCGA. Result(s): For all 8 clinical studies, the digital twin model accurately simulated both trial arms, compared drug efficacy across arms and predicted which treatment was most active. Unblinded evaluation: Our model accurately predicted gemcitabine would have greater clinical benefit than 5-FU (LOR -0.10, P <0.0001) in metastatic pancreatic cancer. In advanced breast cancer, the model predicted docetaxel had a higher response rate than doxorubicin, and carboplatin response rates were similar to docetaxel in BRCA wild-type patients. In platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, the model predicted cisplatin-based combination had a higher response rate than paclitaxel. Blinded evaluation: Using data for paclitaxel, the model correctly predicted that nabpaclitaxel+gemcitabine response rates were higher than gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer (predicted LOR -0.090, p = <0.001). In all 3 early breast cancer studies, predictions mirrored clinical trial results, adjuvant ECF > CMF, adjuvant TC > AC and adjuvant tamoxifen was superior to capecitabine. The underlying pan-tumour Overall Survival model used a Random Survival Forest approach, trained on 23 cancers with predictive accuracy of 0.78 AUC ROC and C-index 0.71. To enable cohort enrichment for drug response, the model segmented patient cohorts into treatment responder and non-responder. Using this approach, the log odds increased for drug response rate for 16 of the 19 different cancers and 14 of the different 17 drugs. Conclusion(s): Our digital twin model represents transformative technology for clinical trial simulation with strong potential for accelerating and de-risking clinical drug development, and utility for synthetic control arms.

N2  -  Background: Initial results of the open-label, single-arm phase II clinical trial, we had demonstrated anlotinib plus albumin-bound paclitaxel treatment activity and favorable tolerance in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant primary epithelial ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma (SGO 2023. Oral featured poster 549). Here we update the latest efficacy and safety data in enrolled patients. Method(s): In this study, 44 patients diagnosed with platinumresistant or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer were planned to be enrolled. Patients received ab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 30 min every 3 weeks and anlotinib (10mg, po, qd, for 14 days, every 3 weeks) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. For efficacy evaluation, the following were required: measurable disease defined by RECIST 1.1, or if there were no measurable lesions but an elevated CA125 with significant symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or pleural effusion/ascites (Rustin criteria). The primary end point were investigator-confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Result(s): From January 2021 to March 2023, 44 patients were enrolled with amedian age of 49 years(range, 40- 66). 29 patients had measurable lesions and 15 patients had no measurable lesions but an elevated CA125 evaluated according to Rustin criteria. As of efficacy evaluation, 43 out of 44 patients can be analyzed and one without measurable lesions can not be included due to the absence of a post-treatment data. Among the 29 patients with measurable lesions, 16 (55.2%; 95%CI 0.359-0.730) achieved objective responses, including CR in two patients, PR in fourteen, stable disease in thirteen, and PD in zero. In the group of 14 patients without measurable lesions, 9 (60%; 95% CI 0.328-0.825) achieved responses, including CA 125 responses in nine patients, CA 125 no response in four, and CA125 disease progression in one. Overall responses were observed in 25 out of 44 patients (56.8%; 95% CI 0.411-0.713) in the intention-to-treat population, and in the per-protocol population, the response was seen in 25 out of 43 patients (58.1%; 95% CI 0.422-0.726). The grade 3/4 AEs encompassed leukopenia (31 patients, 70.5%), gum-pain (10 patients, 22.7%), hypertension (10 patients, 22.7%), Hand-foot syndrome (4 patients, 9.1%). Conclusion(s): Updated results reconfirm a favorable antitumor activity and manageable safety from anlotinib plus albumin-bound paclitaxel in the treatment of recurrent ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma. Further survival results are expected.

N2  -  Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary represents a rare and malignant extrahepatic tumor that shares morphological and immunophenotypic similarities with hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the ambiguous histomorphology and aggressive behavior, the diagnosis and management of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary present unique challenges. Here, we present a 67-year-old woman with massive ascites and disseminated peritoneal implants at initial diagnosis. She was treated with six cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel + nedaplatin + bevacizumab) and a debulking surgery, followed by eight cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab). Elaborate pathology workup found significant involvement of angiogenesis in the tumor and confirmed the diagnosis via immunohistochemistry. Further molecular characterization of the tumor by whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel heterozygous germline mutation (NM_000057.2, c.1290_1291delinsATCAGGCCTCCATAG, p.Y430fs1) in gene BLM, likely pathogenic, suggesting a potential candidate for Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. For the maintenance therapy, she received a combination of the PARP inhibitor niraparib and the antiangiogenic anlotinib. As of now, the patient has achieved a partial response, with no apparent evidence of disease progression observed nearly 30 months. Our study sheds light on the WES-based profiling in rare cancers to screen for any treatable targets with otherwise no standard therapeutic options. The promising results with the niraparib-anlotinib combination suggest its potential as a maintenance therapy option for hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary, which warrants validation in future larger cohort.Copyright © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  -  Introduction: Relacorilant (CORT125134, Corcept Therapeutics) is a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator, which reverses the glucocorticoid-mediated anti-apoptotic effects and restores the taxane chemosensitivity in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Given those preclinical findings, relacorilant is currently under investigation in clinical trials in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer setting. Areas covered: Already published preclinical and clinical evidence of relacorilant antitumor activity was analyzed and discussed. Ongoing clinical trials registered on clincaltrials.gov were also reported. The review aimed to summarize the status of relacorilant, the mechanism of action, the published and ongoing trials, and its safety and efficacy. Expert opinion: Relacorilant combined with nab-paclitaxel, may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. After preliminary positive results in terms of clinical efficacy, a randomized phase III trial is ongoing to confirm the findings from the published phase II study.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  -  Purpose: AB160 is a 160-nm nano-immunoconjugate consisting of nab-paclitaxel (ABX) nanoparticles noncovalently coated with bevacizumab (BEV) for targeted delivery into tissues expressing high levels of VEGF. Preclinical data showed that AB160 resulted in greater tumor targeting and tumor inhibition compared with sequential treatment with ABX then BEV. Given individual drug activity, we investigated the safety and toxicity of AB160 in patients with gynecologic cancers. Patients and Methods: A 3+3 phase I trial was conducted with three potential dose levels in patients with previously treated endometrial, cervical, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to ascertain the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). AB160 was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (ABX 75-175 mg/m2, BEV 30-70 mg/m2). Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. Result(s): No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen among the three dose levels tested. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia, thromboembolic events, and leukopenia. DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2) was chosen as the RP2D. Seven of the 19 patients with measurable disease (36.8%) had confirmed partial responses (95% confidence interval, 16.3%-61.6%). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that AB160 allowed 50% higher paclitaxel dosing and that paclitaxel clearance mirrored that of therapeutic antibodies. Conclusion(s): The safety profile and clinical activity of AB160 supports further clinical testing in patients with gynecologic cancers; the RP2D is DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2).Copyright ©2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Purpose: This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalating, phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary tumor response of a nanoparticulate formulation of paclitaxel (Nanotax) administered intraperitoneally for multiple treatment cycles in patients with solid tumors predominantly confined to the peritoneal cavity for whom no other curative systemic therapy treatment options were available. Method(s): Twenty-one patients with peritoneal malignancies received Nanotax in a modified dose-escalation approach utilizing an accelerated titration method. All patients enrolled had previously received chemotherapeutics and undergone surgical procedures, including 33 % with optimal debulking. Six doses (50-275 mg/m2) of Cremophor-free Nanotax were administered intraperitoneally for one to six cycles (every 28 days). Result(s): Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of Nanotax did not lead to increases in toxicity over that typically associated with intravenous (IV) paclitaxel. No patient reported >=Grade 2 neutropenia and/or >=Grade 3 neurologic toxicities. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia unlikely related to study medication occurred in one patient. The peritoneal concentration-time profile of paclitaxel rose during the 2 days after dosing to peritoneal fluid concentrations 450-2900 times greater than peak plasma drug concentrations and remained elevated through the entire dose cycle. Best response assessments were made in 16/21 patients: Four patients were assessed as stable or had no response and twelve patients had increasing disease. Five of 21 patients with advanced cancers survived longer than 400 days after initiation of Nanotax IP treatment. Conclusion(s): Compared to IV paclitaxel administration, Cremophor-free IP administration of Nanotax provides higher and prolonged peritoneal paclitaxel levels with minimal systemic exposure and reduced toxicity.Copyright © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg

N2  -  Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with poor outcomes due to late presentation. Globally, 5 year-survival (5YS) is <10%, with metastatic 5YS being 3%. The 5YS in Australia is slightly better at approximately 12.6% includes early stage disease as well as locally advanced and metastatic. A recent Lancet Oncology registry based study identified Western Australia as having the global best survival for cancers of pancreas, stomach, ovary and colon. We evaluated factors contributing to survival and wish to report updated survival data. Method(s): We conducted a prospective cohort study with all patients treated for PDAC at our institution between April 2008 and February 2023, and followed up to March 2024. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 2 or less prior to starting treatment. Overall survival (OS) was calculated via Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): There were 330 patients identified in our cohort. Of these, at diagnosis 170 patients (51.5%) were metastatic and 160 patients (48.5%) locally advanced disease. The median age of patients was 66 years (range, 25-87 years). The treatment modalities varied between patients. Overall 160 patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, 79 patients had chemo-radiotherapy, 1 patient received Cyberknife stereotactic body RT alone, 40 patients had chemotherapy and surgery and 50 patients had tri-modality treatment including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy. Across the groups who received chemotherapy, 140 patients received mFOLFIRINOX as second-line and 60 patients received gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel as third-line retreatment. The OS of the combined groups was 22 months [95% CI, 19.5-24.5]. In the metastatic group OS was 16 months (95% CI, 14-18) and in the non-metastatic group OS was 31 months (95% CI, 27-35). 5YS overall for our cohort was 12.7%, with metastatic 5YS was 3.5% and non-metastatic was 18.75% respectively. Conclusion(s): This prospective analysis shows a significant prolonged OS for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease. Factors identified as hypothesis of improved outcomes as demonstrated with the use of second-line mFOLFIRINOX, as well as third-line retreatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  Germline mutation status of BRCA1/2 and other breast cancer predisposition genes as predictive and prognostic biomarker: Results of the GeparX study (GeparX-BRCA) Background: There is accumulating evidence that the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in breast tumorigenesis, particularly in the development of BRCA1-mutated tumors. Targeting the RANK pathway has been shown to attenuate breast cancer (BC) proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Studies using bone modifying agents as adjuvant therapy showed reduced rates of bone metastases and improved BC survival, as well as prevention of treatment-induced skeletal events. The GeparX clinical trial assessed the use of denosumab in patients with primary BC as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to enhance pathological complete response (pCR) rate and improve outcome. The trial randomized 780 patients twice to a total of 4 treatment groups (to receive or not receive denosumab; to receive nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks or days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, both followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, 90/600 mg/m2 every 2 weeks/every 3 weeks according to the investigator's choice). Carboplatin was given in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and trastuzumab biosimilar ABP980 plus pertuzumab was given in human epidermal growth factor-2-positive (HER2+) BC. Overall, the pCR (ypT0 ypN0) rate was 41% with denosumab vs 43% without; nab-paclitaxel at a dosage of 125 mg/m2 weekly resulted in a significantly higher pCR rate of 45% vs 39% with a dosage of 125 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Research question: Does the germline mutation status of BRCA1/2 and other BC predisposition genes affect treatment outcome in the GeparX study? Methods: Genetic germline analyses assessing pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and 16 other BC predisposition genes were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Cologne, Germany; 767 patients were included in this secondary investigation (308 TNBC, 306 HER2-/hormone receptor positive [HR+], 153 HER2+). Finding(s): Germline BRCA1/2 mutations were present in 91/767 patients (11.9%), with a higher mutation prevalence in TNBC (50/308, 16.2%) and HER2-/HR+ BC (37/306, 12.1%), and a low mutation prevalence in HER2+ BC (4/153, 2.6%). Overall, the pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) was elevated in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs non-carriers (49.5% vs 41.1%, respectively; overall: OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.90-2.17; TNBC: OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67-2.32; HER2-/HR+: OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.86-3.88). Highest pCR rates were observed in TNBC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs non-carriers (60% vs. 54.7%, respectively). Highest pCR rate differences were observed HER2-/HR+ BC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs noncarriers (32.4% vs. 20.8%, respectively). Regarding treatment arms, both BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers benefitted most from nab-paclitaxel at a dosage of 125 mg/m2 weekly vs 125 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: 55.3% vs 43.2%, respectively; OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.71-3.73; non-carriers: 43.7% vs 38.6%, respectively; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91-1.68). No beneficial effect was observed for denosumab vs no denosumab (51.1% vs 47.8% for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, respectively; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.50-2.60; 40.3% vs 41.9% for non-carriers, respectively; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69-1.27). Of the 617 BRCA1/2-negative patients, 59 patients carried mutations in other BC predisposition genes which did not predict therapy response compared to patients without any mutation. Conclusion(s): Irrespective of the treatment arm, higher pCR rates were observed in BRCA1/2 mutations carriers vs non-carriers. Both BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and noncarriers benefitted most from weekly nab-paclitaxel. No pronounced effect was observed for denosumab in either group.

N2  -  Background: Many cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) bind regulatory cyclins to control cell cycle progression. Aberrant CDK2 activation occurs in selected cancers (e.g., ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer) through CCNE1 amplification, leading to Rb phosphorylation, inactivation, and cell cycle checkpoint dysregulation. CCNE1 amplification and subsequent cyclin E overexpression are associated with chemotherapy resistance and shorter progression-free and overall survival. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to inhibit aberrant CDK2 activation and elicit positive clinical benefit in these patients. BLU-222 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable, investigational CDK2 inhibitor with demonstrated activity in preclinical CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancer models. Here, we explored additional, specific biomarkers to predict BLU-222 sensitivity in ovarian and endometrial cancer as monotherapy or in novel combination treatment strategies. Method(s): In vitro antiproliferative effect of BLU-222 was assessed by CyQuant in a panel of CCNE1-aberrant or CCNE1-normal ovarian and endometrial cell lines. Combination of BLU-222 and paclitaxel was evaluated by dosing matrix; synergy was calculated using SynergyFinder. In vivo antitumor activity of BLU-222 as a single agent or combined with paclitaxel was measured in CCNE1-aberrant endometrial cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (XenoSTART). Result(s): In ovarian and endometrial cell lines, CCNE1 amplification (copy number >= 6) predicted strong antiproliferative response to BLU-222. Using multivariate biomarker analysis, high p16 protein expression and wild-type Rb protein were identified as additional predictive markers for response to BLU-222 in CCNE1-aberrant cell lines. BLU-222 with paclitaxel was broadly active in endometrial cancer cell lines, with the strongest combination effect in cells with high CCNE1 expression, wild-type Rb protein, and low p16 protein expression. In vivo, BLU-222 elicited strong monotherapy antitumor response in CCNE1 copy number-aberrant endometrial cancer PDX models, and this effect was strengthened with the combination of paclitaxel. Conclusion(s): In preclinical models of CCNE1-aberrant endometrial cancer, BLU-222 demonstrated enhanced activity in combination with paclitaxel. Furthermore, Rb and p16 protein expression can be used in conjunction with CCNE1 copy number to predict response to both BLU-222 monotherapy and combination treatment. These data provide a rationale for using BLU-222 in combination with paclitaxel and demonstrate the potential benefit of using specific biomarkers to predict response.

N2  -  The therapeutic efficacy of a novel oral Paclitaxel formulation was evaluated and compared in Balb/c nude mice bearing PDX NSCLC, gastric cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer treated with Abraxane, Taxol, Lenvatinib and Sorafenib. Therapeutic parameters including tumor volume, tumor growth inhibition (TGI), and treatment-to-control ratio (T/C) were compared among different treatment groups. The drug tolerance, cytotoxicity and safety profile of the oral Paclitaxel formulations were evaluated in Balb/c nude mice and beagle dogs. The tumor distribution of Paclitaxel in NCI-N87 gastric cancer-bearing mice after administration of oral Paclitaxel formulation and Paclitaxel Injection was investigated. The oral Paclitaxel formulation administrated at 100 mg/Kg demonstrated significant better therapeutic efficacy than Albumin-bound Paclitaxel for Injectable Suspension at 30 mg/Kg and Paclitaxel Injection at 15 mg/Kg for NCI-N87 gastric cancer-bearing mice, while the same 100 mg/Kg dose demonstrated noninferior therapeutic efficacy to Abraxane and significant better therapeutic efficacy than Taxol in Hs467T gastric cancer-bearing mice. The oral Paclitaxel formulation administrated at 180 mg/Kg demonstrated noninferior therapeutic efficacy compared with Lenvatinib at 40 mg/Kg, and significant better therapeutic efficacy than Sorafenib at 30 mg/Kg for Hep G2 liver cancer-bearing mice, while the oral paclitaxel at 180 mg/Kg showed inferior therapeutic efficacy than Lenvatinib at 30 mg/Kg but noninferior therapeutic efficacy to Sorafenib at 30 mg/Kg for Huh-7 liver cancer-bearing mice. The oral Paclitaxel formulation administrated at 100 mg/Kg demonstrated significant better therapeutic efficacy than Abraxane for Injectable Suspension at 30 mg/Kg and Taxol at 15 mg/Kg for NCI-H358 NSCLC-bearing mice. The oral Paclitaxel formulation administrated at 100 mg/Kg demonstrated noninferior therapeutic efficacy to Abraxane for Injectable Suspension at 30 mg/Kg and significant better therapeutic efficacy than Taxol at 15 mg/Kg for MDAMB- 231 breast cancer-bearing mice. The oral Paclitaxel formulation administrated at 100 mg/Kg demonstrated noninferior therapeutic efficacy to Abraxane at 30 mg/Kg and significant better therapeutic efficacy than Taxol at 15 mg/Kg for SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer-bearing mice. The gastric tumor distribution of Paclitaxel between 6-24 hour was similar after oral and intravenous administration. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of the oral Paclitaxel was determined to be >= 200 mg/Kg in mice and >= 8.0 mg/Kg in beagle dogs when dosing at Q3DX3Weeks, there were no significant body weight losses, tissue damages and animal death observed during the long-term safety assessment study. The oral Paclitaxel formulation demonstrated better or noninferior therapeutic efficacy in five different PDX tumor-bearing mice compared with standard treatment drugs, good safety and low cytotoxicity at high doses in long-term safety and toxicity studies were observed in both mice and beagle dogs. The oral Paclitaxel formulation showed promising therapeutic potential for various cancer treatment and conducting "chemotherapy at home" with lower medical costs.

N2  -  Introduction/Background Single agent chemotherapies are commonly used in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, but outcomes are generally poor. Cortisol, which acts by binding to the glu-cocorticoid receptor (GR), can suppress apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. The GR is abundantly expressed in ovarian tumours and high GR expression is associated with poor outcomes. Data indicate that the selective GR modulator relacorilant can reverse cortisol's anti-apoptotic effects, thereby enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden compared to nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. This phase 3 study aims to confirm the findings of the phase 2 study in a larger patient population. Methodology ROSELLA (GOG-3073, ENGOT-Ov72/MITO, NCT05257408) is a randomised, phase 3, 2-arm, open-label study of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel vs nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Women with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1-3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including prior bev-acizumab, and at least 1 line of platinum-based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinum-refractory disease are excluded from the trial. Approximately 360 patients are being randomised 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab paclitaxel infusion) + nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Stratification factors are prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of world (North America vs. Europe vs. rest of world). Results The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, DoR, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacody-namics, patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life. Conclusion N/A.

N2  -  Background: Platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer has an abysmal prognosis with limited treatment options. Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), angiogenesis, and immune checkpoint inhibitors might improve the outcomes of platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer, but accurate patient selections for those therapies remain a significant clinical challenge. Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biomarker-driven combinatorial therapies of pamiparib, tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab-paclitaxel in platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer. Study Hypothesis: A precision medicine combination of PARP inhibitors, anti-angiogenic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy will improve disease outcomes of platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer by accounting for genomic and immunologic features. Trial Design: The BRIGHT Trial is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase II, umbrella study planning to enroll 160 patients with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer from 11 clinical centers in China. Patients are assigned to one of three experimental arms based on biomarkers. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations will receive pamiparib plus bevacizumab (arm 1, n=40) regardless of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count. Patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 (BRCAwt) and >=3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive the combination of tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab-paclitaxel (arm 2, n=50), while BRCAwt patients with <3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive bevacizumab plus dose-dense nab-paclitaxel (arm 3, n=50). After completing patient enrollment in arm 2, another 20 BRCAwt patients with >=3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will be included as an arm 2 expansion. Treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, and all adverse events will be recorded. Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Eligible patients include those aged >=18 with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian cancer, platinum-resistant recurrence, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Primary Endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigators by the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Sample Size: 160 patients. Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results: Recruitment is estimated to be completed by 2024 and results may be published by 2027.

N2  -  Olaparib was the first poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor approved for patients with cancer with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 in China. To the best of our knowledge, however, no study has described the efficacy of olaparib for patients with breast cancer with double mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The present case report describes a patient with breast cancer with deleterious germline muta- tions in both BRCA1 and BRCA2. The 56-year-old patient with multiple metastatic breast cancer underwent breast cancer resection with 12 years interval between removal of the left and right breast. Germline mutations in both BRCA1 (S405X) and BRCA2 (W2990X) were identified by NGS. She received two cycles of chemotherapy with a combination of albumin-bound paclitaxel and capecitabine; the response was progressive disease. Subsequently, the patient was treated with a gradual dosage of decreasing olaparib (600 to 300 mg BID) for 6 months until grade 3 anemia could not be alleviated by giving erythropoietin and iron, and CT imaging showed a partial response (35% reduction). The patient then switched to exemestane therapy due to the continuous grade 3 anemia. In conclusion, the present study reported a female patient with double heterozygosity of BRCA1 and BRCA2 who benefited from olaparib monotherapy. Thus, olaparib may be a suitable treatment for such patients.Copyright © 2024 Shao and Di et al.

N2  -  Paclitaxel belongs to the diterpenoid compounds and has good antitumor activity against various cancers such as ovarian cancer and breast cancer. Due to its poor solubility, paclitaxel has significant adverse reactions when it was used directly, limiting its clinical application. Serum albumin nanoparticles can compensate for the inherent defects of paclitaxel, enhance the stability of the drug in the body, improve its bioavailability and targeting ability, achieve the purpose of enhancing efficacy and reducing toxicity, and to some extent solve the problem of paclitaxel. This review summarizes the preparation process of serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles, the application of modified serum albumin in paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles, in order to provide theoretical guidance for the development of serum albumin based nanodrug delivery systems that meet actual clinical applications.Copyright © 2023 Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry.

N2  -  Basophils are involved in manifestations of hypersensitivity, however, the current understanding of their propensity for activation and their prognostic value in cancer patients remains unclear. As in healthy and atopic individuals, basophil populations were identified in blood from ovarian cancer patients (n = 53) with diverse tumor histologies and treatment histories. Ex vivo basophil activation was measured by CD63 expression using the basophil activation test (BAT). Irrespective of prior treatment, basophils could be activated by stimulation with IgE-(anti-FcepsilonRI and anti-IgE) and non-IgE (fMLP) mediated triggers. Basophil activation was detected by ex vivo exposure to paclitaxel, but not to other anti-cancer therapies, in agreement with a clinical history of systemic hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. Protein and gene expression analyses support the presence of basophils (CCR3, CD123, FcepsilonRI) and activated basophils (CD63, CD203c, tryptase) in ovarian tumors. Greater numbers of circulating basophils, cells with greater capacity for ex vivo stimulation (n = 35), and gene signatures indicating the presence of activated basophils in tumors (n = 439) were each associated with improved survival in ovarian cancer. Circulating basophils in cancer patients respond to IgE-and non-IgE-mediated signals and could help identify hypersensitivity to therapeutic agents. Activated circulating and tumor-infiltrating basophils may be potential biomarkers in oncology.Copyright © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  -  Recently, the results of gastric cancer treatment have improved; however, its characteristics in adolescents and young adults are not well known. We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered.Copyright © 2023, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.

N2  -  We report the case of a long-term-surviving adolescent and young adult patient with unresectable advanced gastric cancer for whom multidisciplinary treatment was effective. A 29-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further examination following a diagnosis of gastric cancer by a local physician. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a deep ulcerated lesion in the lower third of the stomach, and analysis of biopsy specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast- enhanced computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening in the lower third of the stomach. The patient underwent distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, including resection of localized peritoneal metastases, followed by Roux-en- Y reconstruction. The pathological diagnosis was serosa-invading poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with 1 lymph node metastasis measuring 6.0x5.5 cm in the posterior wall of the lower third of the stomach and negative immunohistochemical staining for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy with S-1 and oxaliplatin. She developed bilateral ovarian metastases measuring 13.0 cm and 7.8 cm after 17 months. The patient presented with severe lower abdominal pain and underwent an emergency bilateral ovarian metastasectomy, which revealed torsion of the right ovarian tumor, which had twisted twice on its pedicle, and a left ovarian mass. After the operation, 41 courses of ramucirumab with nab-paclitaxel were administered as a second-line treatment, and she received systemic drug treatment. Sixty months after the gastrectomy, the patient developed left hydronephrosis due to peritoneal metastases and was treated with nivolumab after ureteral stent replacement. No effective treatment was proposed in cancer multigene panel testing, and she died 66 months after the initial treatment because of disease progression. Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment, including surgical and local therapy for peritoneal dissemination based on drug therapy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer, may result in long-term survival. Further research and accumulation of such cases would lead to the development of novel treatments.

N2  -  KRAS mutations (mt) occur in up to 98% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and represent a key initiating event in PDAC carcinogenesis. Therapeutic efforts targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway with MEK-only inhibitors have been unsuccessful in substantially modifying PDAC prognosis. Thus, novel strategies are needed to overcome putative mechanisms of resistance to MEK inhibition such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation. Another hallmark of PDAC is its high stromal density, which is thought to limit the penetration of cytotoxic drugs and T cells into the tumor and has been shown to be correlated with FAK hyperactivation, altogether supporting cotargeting the MAPK and FAK pathways to achieve deep and durable responses for patients with PDAC. Avutometinib is a RAF/MEK clamp that potently inhibits MEK kinase activity and induces dominant negative RAF-MEK complexes preventing phosphorylation of MEK by ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. This unique mechanism allows avutometinib to block MEK signaling without the compensatory re-activation of MEK that appears to limit the efficacy of MEK-only inhibitors. Preclinically, avutometinib has shown strong anti-proliferative potency across tumor cell lines carrying KRAS mt including PDAC cell lines. Clinically, avutometinib in combination with the FAK inhibitor (FAKi) defactinib received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with recurrent lowgrade serous ovarian cancer. Here, we tested the combination of avutometinib and FAK inhibition with standard of care chemotherapy in PDAC mouse models. In a KRAS/p53 pancreatic cancer mouse model, we found that whereas the combination of avutometinib + FAKi induced tumor inhibition and increased survival, addition of chemotherapy (gemcitabine + paclitaxel as a surrogate for nabpaclitaxel) to avutometinib/FAKi induced tumor regression. These results support the ongoing clinical study of avutometinib and defactinib in combination with standard of care chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel) for patients with front-line metastatic PDAC (NCT05669482). Other combinations being explored preclinically include avutometinib with G12D inhibition (G12Di) in KRAS G12D PDAC, which accounts for 28% of patients with PDAC. In 3D culture, avutometinib was synergistic with the G12Di MRTX1133 in reducing viability of a panel of KRAS G12D PDAC cell lines. In mouse models, avutometinib enhanced anti-tumor efficacy of MRTX1133 in a KRAS G12D pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenograft model. Furthermore, in KRAS mt PDAC cell lines, avutometinib was synergistic with the autophagy inhibitors chloroquine or apilimod. Indeed, dual treatment with avutometinib + MRTX1333 synergistically decreased proliferation and increased autophagic flux in KRAS G12D PDAC cell lines, supporting testing the triple combination of avutometinib + G12Di + autophagy inhibitor in patients with KRAS G12D pancreatic cancers. In conclusion, we show that avutometinib is a unique RAF/MEK clamp with the potential to become the backbone of therapy for pancreatic cancers.

N2  -  Present research work is carried out to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions between combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab and single medication of trastuzumab in treatment of ovarian cancer. A total of 80 recurrent ovarian cancer patients in Stage III B or IV confirmed by histopathological examination and/or cytological examination were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups, i.e. the combined medication group (n=37) and the single medication group (n=43). Patients in two groups underwent therapy for 4 cycles to evaluate the short-term efficacy and adverse reactions of these two methods. The control rates of the combined medication group and the single medication group were 86.4% and 81.4%, respectively, while the partial response rates were 45.9% and 44.2%, respectively. As for the overall survival (OS), the OS in the single medication group was 7.0 months, while that in the combined medication group was 7.3 months (p=0.63). Incidence of neutropenia in the single and combined medication groups were respectively 51.2% and 40.5%, while the incidence rates of leukopenia in Stage III or IV were 44.2% and 24.3%, respectively (p<0.001) and the differences between two groups were statistically significant. Also, comparison of the incidence rates of thrombocytopenia between the single (53.5%) and combined (23.6%) medication groups showed statistical significance. With promising efficacy, few adverse reaction and high safety, combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab is more applicable to the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Background: Germline pathogenetic mutations in BRCA1/2 genes are described in pancreatic cancer patients (PCP) in about 5-9% of cases. The purpose of this study was to determine their relevance in an unselected consecutive cohort of PCP describing family and clinical history. Method(s): Patients (pts) were recruited at a single cancer center from September 2019 to October 2020. Participants provided blood for DNA analysis; cancer family history and treatment records were reviewed; DNA was analyzed by Next Generation Sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for germline variants in BRCA1/2 Results: 69 pts were included, 61 (88,4%) with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer received first line chemotherapy and 38 (62%) were full eligible for BRCA analysis; 8 out of 69 pts were BRCA screened even if in adjuvant setting, 10 patients are still under evaluation. Out of the 38 first line screened PCP germline BRCA mutations were found in 9 (19%): 4 pts (8,7%) with pathogenetic BRCA-2 variants (subgroup 1 - S1) and 5 pts (10,8%) with variants of unknown significances (VUSs), i.e. c.5339T>C and c.5096G>A in BRCA1 (subgroup 2 - S2). Samples from 29 pts were established as BRCA wild-type (subgroup 3 - S3). Pathogenetic BRCA-2 variants were observed in 2 male and 2 female (median age, 61.5 years, range 48-69), 3 out 4 without family history of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer, one patient (pt) had ovarian cancer family history. All pts had a negative personal history of others cancers. All S1 pts received FOLFIRINOX regimen achieving one complete response, 2 partials responses and 1 disease progression with RECIST criteria. The S2 included 2 male and 3 female (median age, 61 years, range 45-70) 2 with family history of pancreatic cancer, no pt had personal history of others cancers; 2 pts had stable disease and 3 disease progression receiving platinum-based regimen (4 pts) and gemcitabine/nabpaclitaxel (1 pt), respectively. Platinum responders were observed only in the well known pathogenetic BRCA-2 variants group with twice a median progression-free survival (PFS, months -ms-) as compared to the one observed in VUSs group. (>6 C.I. 95% 2- >12 ms; vs 3 ms, 95% C.I. 3-12 ms). S3 included 9 male and 20 female, (median age, 66 years, range 42-78); 5 pts had family history of pancreatic or breast cancer, 5 pts had a personal history of other cancers (breast and thyroid). In this group,16 pts received a platinum based regimen and 12 pts have been treated without platinum based regimen. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that: 1) BRCA pathogenetic mutations rate (8,7%) is in line with literature data and seems not to be related with family or personal history, and to be associated with a better outcome; 2) No BRCA mutations were detected in patients over 70 years. 3) VUSs subgroup do not seem to benefit from platinum-regimen.

N2  -  Background: AB160 is a 160 nm nanoimmunoconjugate consisting of nab-paclitaxel (NP) nanoparticles non-covalently coated with bevacizumab (BEV) for targeted delivery into tissues expressing high levels of vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Both taxanes (GOG-0129C, GOG-0126R, GOG-0127V) and BEV (GOG-0229E, AURELIA, GOG-0227C) have demonstrated clinical activity in previously treated metastatic endometrial cancer (EC), ovarian cancer (OC), and cervical cancer (CC), respectively. Method(s): A 3+3 phase I trial was conducted in patients with EC, platinumresistant OC and CC who had prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AB160 administered intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The starting dose level (DL1) was NP at 125 mg/m2 with BEV at 50 mg/m2 . There were 2 higher dose levels: DL2 (NP at 150 mg/m2 with BEV at 60 mg/m2) and DL3 (NP at 175 mg/m2 with BEV at 70 mg/m2). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) included grade (G) 4 neutropenia or anemia, PLT < 25,000, serum creatinine >=2 times baseline, G2-4 neurologic toxicity or G3-4 non-hematologic toxicities. Disease evaluations were conducted after every 2 treatment cycles using RECIST criteria. Patients were treated until disease progression or intolerability. Samples were collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Result(s): Nine women 41 -74 years of age (median 57) have enrolled (5 with EC and 4 with OC); data are available for the first 8. No DLTs have been observed among the 3 women enrolled on DL1, 3 women on DL2, and 2 women on DL3. All 3 patients on DL3 continue on treatment. The other 6 patients have discontinued due to adverse reactions (3), progression (2), and patient choice (1). The median number of cycles administered is 6 (4-14). The most common severe (G3/4) toxicities include neutropenia (37.5%) and leukopenia (25%). There have been 5 partial responses (62.5%): 1 on DL1 and 2 each on DL2 and DL3. PK evaluation is pending. Conclusion(s):AB160 therapy is safe and demonstrates promising clinical activity in patients with previously treated metastatic gynecologic malignancies. Further clinical testing is being pursued in this patient population.

N2  -  Background: Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway activation has been linked with chemotherapy resistance (CTR). RELA (formerly CORT125134, Corcept Therapeutics), a potent selective GR modulator, in combination with paclitaxel reduced CTR and enhanced activity against tumor growth in preclinical models of solid tumors. Method(s): Patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors, <=3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy, ECOG status 0-1, and adequate marrow function received RELA (100, 150, or 200mg) + NP (60, 80, or 100mg/m2). Once daily RELA was given either continuously (CON) or intermittently (INT) (day before, of, and after NP). NP was dosed weekly for 3 of 4 weeks (wks) of a 28-day cycle. Prior NP therapy was allowed. Result(s): 72 pts have been enrolled [mean age 60 (range 18-81), mean number of prior therapies 3, prior taxane (TXN) treatment 54/72 (75%)]. 61 pts received >=1 dose of RELA. Grade >=3 AE >=10% for CON: neutropenia (6/43, 14%); INT: neutropenia (6/18, 33%), anemia (2/18, 11%), and mucosal inflammation (2/18, 11%). Prophylactic G-CSF became mandatory in later cohorts. Recommended Phase 2 Dose: RELA 100mg-CON/150mg-INT + NP 80mg/m2 (exposures similar to NP 100mg/m2 due to CYP3A4 inhibition by RELA). Disease control (DC) > 24 wks was noted in 5/27 (19%) PDAC pts: 3 PR, 2 SD (27- 50 wks). 3 pts achieved benefit despite progression on prior TXN with time to progression (TTP) 1.9-3.6x longer than prior TXN. 4/13 (31 %) OvCA pts had DC > 24 wks: 1 CR, 1 PR, 2 SD (33-54+ wks). 1 pt had TTP 4.4x longer than prior TXN. 3 additional PRs were observed: acinar pancreatic cancer, TTP 31 wks (4.4x prior TXN); vulvar SCC HPV+, TTP 55 wks (3.9x prior TXN); cholangiocarcinoma, DC 29+ wks. Expression of GR-regulated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and CTR distinguished pts with DC from pts without DC, providing proof of mechanism. Conclusion(s): RELA+NP resulted in durable disease control in pts with metastatic PDAC, OvCA, and other solid tumors, including those that have progressed on prior TXN. TTP was often several-fold longer than previously achieved on TXN therapy. Toxicities are manageable with prophylaxis for neutropenia. Further evaluation in OvCA NCT03776812, PDAC, and others are planned.

N2  -  In recent years, a growing number of studies have evaluated the role of exosomes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) demonstrating their involvement in a multitude of pathways, including the induction of chemoresistance. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the current knowledge on the role of exosomes in the resistance to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, which are two of the most commonly used drugs for the treatment of PDAC patients. Exosomes are vesicular cargos that transport multiple miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins from one cell to another cell and some of these factors can influence specific determinants of gemcitabine activity, such as the nucleoside transporter hENT1, or multidrug resistance proteins involved in the resistance to paclitaxel. Additional mechanisms underlying exosome-mediated resistance include the modulation of apoptotic pathways, cellular metabolism, or the modulation of oncogenic miRNA, such as miR-21 and miR-155. The current status of studies on circulating exosomal miRNA and their possible role as biomarkers are also discussed. Finally, we integrated the preclinical data with emerging clinical evidence, showing how the study of exosomes could help to predict the resistance of individual tumors, and guide the clinicians in the selection of innovative therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  -  PURPOSEDespite therapeutic advances, outcomes for patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer remain poor. Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation with relacorilant may restore chemosensitivity and enhance chemotherapy efficacy.METHODSThis three-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776812) enrolled women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian carcinosarcoma treated with 4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to (1) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m) + intermittent relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab-paclitaxel); (2) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m) + continuous relacorilant (100 mg once daily); or (3) nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/). Nab-paclitaxel was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment; objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were secondary end points.RESULTSA total of 178 women were randomly assigned. Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; log-rank test P =.038; median follow-up, 11.1 months) and DOR (HR, 0.36; P =.006) versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy, while ORR was similar across arms. At the preplanned OS analysis (median follow-up, 22.5 months), the OS HR was 0.67 (P =.066) for the intermittent arm versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Continuous relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed numerically improved median PFS but did not result in significant improvement over nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Adverse events were comparable across study arms, with neutropenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue/asthenia being the most common grade 3 adverse events.CONCLUSIONIntermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS, DOR, and OS compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. On the basis of protocol-prespecified Hochberg step-up multiplicity adjustment, the primary end point did not reach statistical significance (P <.025). A phase III evaluation of this regimen is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05257408).Copyright © 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  -  Introduction: Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a major therapeutic challenge in several gynecological and gastro-intestinal malignancies. It is associated with poor quality of life and shorter survival Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a novel technique of intra-peritoneal chemotherapy that pressurizes chemotherapy into de abdominal cavity. Pre-clinical studies have shown that drugs administered by PIPAC have a better penetration depth and an increased distribution into the peritoneum when compared to conventional intraperitoneal therapy. Unfortunately, most of the evidence has been based on retrospective series. Only 3 phase 1 studies have been published, of which only one included ovarian cancer patients. Further, very few drugs were investigated (cisplatin, doxorubicin and oxaliplatin). Material(s) and Method(s): Nab-PIPAC is an open-label phase IB trial investigating the combination of cisplatin at flat dose of 10.5 mg/m2 and escalating dose of nab-paclitaxel with a 3+3 design (7.5, 15, 25, 37.5, 52.5 and 70 mg/m2) that are administrated by PIPAC. Drugs are administered sequentially through intraperitoneal laparoscopic application using a nebuliser to a high-pressure injector at ambient temperature with a maximal upstream pressure of 300 psi is administered. Treatment is maintained for 30 min at a pressure of 12 mm Hg and repeated at 4-6 weeks intervals for three courses in total. The primary objective of this phase IB study is to assess the safety and tolerability of IP administration by PIPAC of Nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. The main outcome is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of nab-paclitaxel administered by PIPAC. Result(s): Recruitment started in September 2021. A total of 12 patients (all female) were included, of whom 10 received at least one PIPAC and accrual is ongoing (4th dose level nab-paclitaxel at 37.5 mg/m2). Median age was 66 years (44-79). Eight patients had ovarian cancer, 3 had gastric cancer and one had pancreatic cancer. In total, 24 PIPAC procedures have been administered. Treatment was well tolerated, and no dose limiting toxicity have been observed so far. Conclusion(s): Nab- PIPAC is the first trial that investigated the tolerability and safety of administering cisplatin and nab-paclitaxel by PIPAC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. So far it is well tolerated, and no dose-limiting dose have been observed. Accrual is ongoing, and final results are expected in 2024.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), an albumin-binding protein, is downregulated by hypermethylation in many cancers. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine can upregulate SPARC in tumors, which may enhance the accumulation of albumin-bound drugs at tumor site. The objectives of this phase I trial was to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose and to assess any clinical activity of the combination of azacytidine and weekly nanoparticle-albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel. METHOD(S): Patients received escalating azacytidine doses daily for 5 days, followed by nab-paclitaxel at the standard 100mg/m2 weekly dose for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were monitored during the first cycle. Serum was obtained at baseline, during and after treatment for correlative study. RESULT(S): All sixteen total patients enrolled were evaluable for toxicity, while 13 patients were evaluable for response. Two of five patients treated with 100mg/m2 of azacytidine had DLT of prolonged grade 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the MTD of azacitidine in this regimen is 75 mg/m2. Three additional patients were treated with no grade 4 toxicity in cycle 1. Clinical activity included 1 complete response (CR) in refractory DLBCL, 2 CR in ovarian cancer, 4 partial responses (PR) in ovarian and endometrial cancer, 4 stable diseases (SD) in lung, sarcoma and pancreatic cancer, 1 unconfirmed PR in breast cancer, and 1 progression of disease in CLL/SLL. CONCLUSION(S): Priming with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, followed by weekly nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 weekly was well tolerated and results in dramatic responses pre-treated cancer patients.

N2  -  Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (iHSRs) to taxanes are observed in 6% and 4% of gynecologic and breast cancer patients, respectively. Drug desensitization is the only option, as no comparable alternative therapy is available. Surfactants in the taxane formulation have been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of iHSRs, although sporadic skin test (ST) positivity and iHSRs to nab-paclitaxel have suggested the involvement of the taxane moiety and/or IgE-mediated pathomechanisms. In vitro diagnostic tests might offer insights into mechanisms underlying iHSRs to taxanes. The aim of the present study was to address this unmet need by developing a novel basophil activation test (BAT). The study included patients (n = 31) undergoing paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy. Seventeen patients presented with iHSRs to paclitaxel (iHSR-Taxpos), and eleven were tolerant (iHSR-Taxneg). Fourteen patients presented with iHSRs to carboplatin (iHSR-Plpos), and fourteen were tolerant (iHSR-Plneg). The BAT median stimulation index (SI) values were 1.563 (range, 0.02-4.11; n = 11) and -0.28 (range -4.88-0.07, n = 11) in iHSR-Taxpos and iHSR-Taxneg, respectively. The BAT median SI values were 4.45 (range, 0.1-26.7; n = 14) and 0 (range, -0.51-1.65; n = 12) in iHSR-Plpos and iHSR-Plneg, respectively. SI levels were not associated with iHSR severity grading. Comparing BAT results in iHSR-Taxpos and iHSR-Taxneg showed the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to be 0.9752 (p = 0.0002). The cutoff calculated by the maximized likelihood ratio identified 90.91% of iHSR-Taxpos patients and 90.91% of iHSR-Taxneg patients. Comparing BAT results for iHSR-Plpos and iHSR-Plneg showed the area under the ROC curve to be 0.9286 (p = 0.0002). The cutoff calculated by the maximized likelihood ratio identified 78.57% of iHSR-Plpos patients and 91.67% of iHSR-Plneg patients. Most iHSR-Taxpos patients for which ST was available (10/11) scored ST-negative and BAT-positive, whereas most iHSR-Plpos patients for which ST was available (14/14) scored both BAT- and ST-positive. This suggested the intervention of non-IgE-mediated mechanisms in iHSR-Taxpos patients. Consistent with this view, an in silico molecular docking analysis predicted the high affinity of paclitaxel to the degranulation-competent MRGPRX2 receptor. This hypothesis warrants further in vitro investigations. In conclusion, the present study provides preliminary proof-of-concept evidence that this novel BAT has potential utility in understanding mechanisms underlying iHSRs to taxanes.Copyright © 2023 by the authors.

N2  -  Introduction This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-p) combined with carboplatin as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen for patients with ovarian cancer (OC). Methods This is a single-center, open phase Ib/II Clinical Trial (ChiCTR1900026893). We enrolled women with unresectable epithelial OC, FIGO stage III or IV. Patients received 3 cycles of NACT, then interval debulking surgery (IDS), followed by 3-6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Each 3-week cycle consisted of carboplatin AUC5 plus nab-p 260 mg/m2(Keaili). In the phase II part, the primary objective was R0 resection rate (figure 1). Results Phase Ib results showed the NACT was safe and tolerable, so the study proceeded to phase II. A total of 50 patients were included in this analysis, 10 patients in the phase Ib and 40 patients in the phase II. Twenty-nine (58%) patients had stage IV. All patients completed planned NACT and 8 (16%) patients experienced delayed chemotherapy due to adverse events (AE). After NACT, the objective response rate was 81.3% (95%CI: 67.4%-91.1%) in 48 patients who had at least one tumor assessment. Among the 45 patients who underwent IDS, 5 patients (11.1%) had surgery delayed due to AE, all patients achieved optimal debulking and 77.8% (95%CI: 62.9%-88.8%) achieved R0 resection. During NACT, the most common grade 3/4 AEs were hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia (78%), leucopenia (48%) and thrombocytopenia (24%). All AEs returned to normal or acceptable levels after receiving appropriate treatment. Conclusion/Implications Nab-p plus carboplatin as a NACT regimen was effective and tolerable for unresectable epithelial OC. (Figure Presented).

N2  -  Introduction Single-agent chemotherapies are commonly used in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (OC), but outcomes are generally poor. Cortisol, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), can suppress apoptotic pathways used by chemotherapy. The selective GR modulator relacorilant may reverse cortisol's anti-apoptotic effects to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory/resistant OC (NCT03776812), intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden vs. nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. The ROSELLA study aims to confirm these findings in a larger patient population. Methods ROSELLA (NCT05257408) is a randomized, phase 3, 2-arm, open-label study of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Approximately 360 women with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1-3 prior systemic anticancer therapies, including prior bevacizumab, and >=1 platinum-based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinumrefractory disease are excluded. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nabpaclitaxel) + nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2); stratified by prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of world (North America vs. Europe vs. rest of world). Nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint is PFS by blinded independent central review. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, DoR, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life. Current Trial Status Currently enrolling.

N2  -  Background: ORIN1001 is a first-in-class small molecule targeting a novel enzyme with a unique mode of inhibition that selectively blocks the Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1a (IRE1) RNAse and blocks X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1) activation in the endoplasmic reticulum. ORIN1001 is now undergoing Phase 1/2 clinical testing in advanced solid tumors. Method(s): In a Phase 1 dose escalation trial (3+3 design), ORIN1001 was administered PO daily as a single agent in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors and in combination with Abraxane in pts with relapsed, refractory breast cancer. Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ORIN1001 was evaluated and a RP2D determined. Result(s): As of Jan, 2023, 30 patients with advanced cancer have received ORIN1001 as a single agent at doses up to 650 mg per day in 21-day continuous cycles and 13 patients with breast cancer have received ORIN1001 at doses up to 400 mg in combination with Abraxane in 28-day continuous cycles. For single agent, DLTs consisting of thrombocytopenia were observed at 200 mg (2 pts) and 650 mg (2 pts) and, rash was observed at 200 mg (1 pt) and 500 mg (1 pt). For combination treatment, DLTs consisting of thrombocytopenia were observed at 300 mg (1 pt), fatigue/ rash at 400 mg (1 pt), febrile neutropenia/low WBC at 400/500 mg (1 pt at each dose). Common (> 15%) adverse events were predominantly nausea and/or vomiting (Grade 1-2 in severity). ORIN1001 exposure increased in a dose proportional manner with a mean T1/2 at steady state of approximately 20 hours. For single agent, best response per RECIST 1.1 was partial response (PR) in 2 of 30 pts. These PRs included a stage IV colon cancer pt exceeding 44 months on treatment at 100 mg, and stage IV ER-/PR-/HER2+ breast cancer pt with 5 months on treatment at 500 mg. Stable disease (SD) was observed in a total of 16 of 30 pts with breast, colorectal, mesothelioma, liver, prostate, kidney or ovarian cancer. For combination therapy with Abraxane, a PR was observed in one ER+/PR-/HER2- breast cancer pt at 300 mg ORIN1001 and SD was observed in 5 of 13 pts. SD included both triple negative and ER+/HER2- breast cancer pts at 300 or 400 mg with ongoing treatment exceeding 5 months. Of note, in a separate Phase 1 oncology basket trial in China, there were 2 PRs; 1 pt with stage IV NSCLC at 300 mg and 1 pt with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer at 100 mg exceeding 9 and 5 months of treatment with ORIN1001 in combination with Abraxane, respectively. Conclusion(s): Phase 1 clinical evaluation of ORIN1001 has demonstrated tolerability and dose proportional PK. The proposed RP2D is estimated to be 500 mg and 300 mg ORIN1001 for single agent and in combination with Abraxane, respectively. Early efficacy data with ORIN1001 demonstrate clinical responses (SD and PR) in multiple pts with heavily-pretreated advanced solid tumors as a single agent or in combination with Abraxane in breast cancer patients.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is an anticancer drug first isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. It has been widely used for the treatment of ovarian, breast, uterine and other cancers because of its low tox-icity, high efficiency and broad-spectrum anticancer activity, and it is considered to be one of the most successful natural anticancer drugs available. Paclitaxel is a microtubule-targeting drug whose main molecular mechanism is to disrupt microtubule dynamics and induce mitotic arrest and cell death. De-spite the many clinical successes of paclitaxel, the extraction of natural paclitaxel from Taxus species has proven to be environmentally unsustainable and economically unviable. As a result, researchers are constantly working to find innovative ways to meet society's need for this drug. Currently, many methods, including artificial cultivation, microbial fermentation, chemical synthesis, and tissue and cell culture, have been explored and developed to obtain paclitaxel. In addition, the poor water solu-bility of paclitaxel has led to significant limitations in its clinical application. Conventional paclitaxel formulations use Cremophor EL and ethanol to dissolve paclitaxel, which can lead to serious side ef-fects. In recent decades, a series of new nanotechnology-based paclitaxel dosage forms have been de-veloped, including albumin-bound paclitaxel, polymeric micellar paclitaxel, polymer-paclitaxel cou-ples, and liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel. These nanoformulations can significantly reduce the toxicity of paclitaxel and greatly improve its anti-tumor efficiency. This paper reviews the development of the production, dosage form and combination therapy of paclitaxel in recent years and presents an outlook, with the aim of providing a theoretical basis and reference for further research on the production and application of paclitaxel in the future.Copyright © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  -  Purpose: To determine the effect of paclitaxel octreotide conjugate (POC) on human ovarian paclitaxel-resistant cell xenograft tumor model and the mechanism underlying reversal of paclitaxel resistance. Method(s): Forty female BALB/c-nu/nu mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 106 paclitaxel-resistant cells (a2780/taxol) per mouse during the logarithmic growth phase of ovarian cancer. They were randomly divided into four groups (control, octreotide, paclitaxel and POC). Immunohistochemical streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) method was used to determine expression of nuclear proliferation antigen (PCNA) while TUNEL method was used to assess apoptosis of human ovarian cancer metastasis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to assay mRNA expression levels of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), multidrug-resistant gene (MDR1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and acetylated tubulin (alpha-tubulin and beta-III-tubulin), while the corresponding protein expressions were assayed using western blotting. Result(s): Immunohistochemical SP showed significantly lower PCNA levels in octreotide, paclitaxel and POC groups than in control mice, but that of POC mice was significantly reduced, relative to those of octreotide and paclitaxel groups (p < 0.05). There were significantly higher expression levels of SSTR2 mRNA and protein in octreotide, paclitaxel and POC groups than in control mice, but they were significantly higher in POC group than in octreotide and paclitaxel groups (p < 0.05). The mRNA and protein expressions of other factors in POC mice were significantly lower than those in both octreotide and paclitaxel groups (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Paclitaxel-octreotide conjugate effectively inhibits the growth of a2780/taxol xenografts in nude mice, induces tumor cell apoptosis, and suppresses tumor cell growth via mechanism involving enhancement of SSTR2 expression, and decreases in levels of acetylated tubulin, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor.Copyright © 2023 The authors.

N2  -  Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is a rare and highly invasive malignant tumor with a lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Due to the difficulty of early diagnosis, most patients are already in the advanced stage when diagnosed, and the prognosis is poor. At present, there is no standard treatment strategy, and the existing treatment methods are not effective, the duration of remission is short, which cannot meet the clinical needs. Here we describe a patient with advanced MPeM, initially misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer, who responded to treatment with bevacizumab in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin. In preparation for cytoreductive surgery (CRS), MPeM was confirmed by laparoscopic peritoneal nodule biopsy combined with histological and immunohistochemical results. Subsequently, due to intolerable neurotoxicity after chemotherapy, she received oral anlotinib therapy on April 25, 2022, and remained stable disease (SD) with the medication, having achieved more than 14 months of progression-free survival (PFS) as of the date of our manuscript submission. The patient's total treatment time was over 19 months. These treatments delayed tumor progression, reduced drug side effects, maintained a good quality of life, and further extended overall survival (OS). Our experience is that on the one hand, it is necessary to increase the clinician's understanding of the disease, and make full use of tissue samples and immunohistochemical staining to reduce the occurrence of misdiagnosis. On the other hand, based on preliminary evidence, we found that oral anlotinib offers a viable maintenance treatment strategy for patients with advanced mesothelioma, which needs to be further explored in future studies.Copyright © 2023 Qu et al.

N2  -  Cutaneous metastases of ovarian cancer are rare and often have poor prognosis. We report a case of a 62-year-old woman with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer, who presented with lung, brain, and multiple skin (nasal and anterior chest wall) metastases approximately six months after the initial diagnosis. In this case, Nijmegen breakage syndrome carrier status caused by RAD50 heterozygous mutation and previous bevacizumab therapy could be the predisposing factor for cutaneous metastases. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy (nasal skin and brain, 30Gy/6f/1.2W) and three courses of chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin, resulting in drastic remission of the cutaneous metastases. Unfortunately, treatment interruption resulted in rapid tumor progression, followed by death. This case represents an interesting example of cutaneous metastasis of ovarian cancer with rare clinical manifestations, unique genetic mutations, and reasonable response to treatment. Chemoradiotherapy might be an appropriate option for cutaneous metastases of ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, we still hope to find out the best treatment strategy after collecting and reviewing more cases in the future.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yingyao, Yan, Qianru, Hong, Chen and Lei.

N2  -  Background: The presence of EGFR mutations (EGFRm) has therapeutic implications in patients (pts) with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In Spain, the frequency of EGFRm in pts with early stage resected NSCLC was not known. The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence and characteristics of EGFRm in pts with early stage surgically resected non-squamous NSCLC. Method(s): Multicenter observational study of adult pt with early-stage non-squamous NSCLC (IA-IIIB) candidates for surgical treatment. The study involved 21 centers in Spain. Pts were required to sign informed consent and to have formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. Analysis of EGFR mutational status was performed in each participating site using Biocartis solution (EGFR IdyllaTM) which recognizes 51 mutations in exons 18-21 in a single tissue section. Result(s): One hundred seventy-two pts were analyzed, median age 67.5 years, 58% male, 31% current smokers and 52% former smokers. The predominant histology was adenocarcinoma (97%) and the most frequent stage was IA (47%). Pathological diagnosis was obtained by surgery in 53% of pts and by biopsy in 47% of pts. Only 4% of pts received neoadjuvant treatment and 21.7% received adjuvant treatment. The most frequent surgery was lobectomy (79%) followed by segmentectomy (15%), pneumonectomy (3%) and wedge resection (3%). All except 1 pt had R0 resection. The prevalence of EGFRm was 15% (25 pt), being deletions in exon 19 (52%) the most frequent alterations, followed by mutations in exon 21 (44%; 40% L858R) and exon 20 (4%). The prevalence of EGFRm by stage is shown in the table. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): In this series of pts operated on for NSCLC, frequency of EGFR mutation was 15%, the most frequent being exon 19 deletions and the L858R mutation, in line with data reported in Spain in advanced NSCLC. These results reinforce the importance of performing EGFRm testing in early-stage NSCLC to identify pt candidates to adjuvant osimertinib.

N2  -  Objectives: Platinum resistance occurs in virtually all patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Single-agent chemotherapies are commonly used in this setting, but outcomes are generally poor, leaving a large unmet need for novel, targeted treatments. Cortisol, which acts by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), can reduce the efficacy of chemotherapies by suppressing the apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. The GR is abundantly expressed in ovarian tumors, and high GR expression is associated with poor outcomes. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that modulation of GR signaling with relacorilant, a selective GR modulator, can reverse the antiapoptotic effects of cortisol, thereby enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase II study in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, and a trend towards improved overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden compared to nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. This phase III study aims to confirm the findings of the phase II study in a larger patient population. Method(s): ROSELLA (GOG-3073, ENGOT-Ov72/MITO, ) is a phase III, randomized, 2-arm, open-label study of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel compared to nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The study is being conducted at multiple sites globally. Approximately 360 patients are being randomized 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab-paclitaxel infusion) + nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Across both arms, nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Stratification factors are prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of the world (North America vs Europe vs rest of world). Women with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1-3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including prior bevacizumab, and at least 1 line of platinum-based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinum-refractory disease are excluded from the trial. The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by a blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, patient-reported outcomes, and quality of life.Copyright © 2023

N2  -  Objectives: AB160 is a 160 nm nano-immunoconjugate consisting of nab-paclitaxel (NP) nanoparticles non-covalently coated with bevacizumab (BEV) for targeted delivery into tissues expressing high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Both taxanes (GOG 0129C, GOG 0126R, GOG 0127 V) and BEV (GOG 0229E, AURELIA, GOG 0227C) have demonstrated clinical activity in heavily treated metastatic endometrial cancer (EC), ovarian cancer (OC), and cervical cancer (CC), respectively. We sought to test the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of AB160 in patients with gynecologic cancers. Method(s): A 3 + 3 phase I trial was conducted in patients with EC, platinum-resistant OC, and CC who had prior systemic treatment for metastatic disease to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AB160 administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The starting dose level (DL1) was NP at 125 mg/m2 with BEV at 50 mg/m2. There were 2 higher dose levels: DL2 (NP at 150 mg/m2 with BEV at 60 mg/m2) and DL3 (NP at 175 mg/m2 with BEV at 70 mg/m2). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) included grade (G) 4 neutropenia or anemia, PLT <25,000, serum creatinine >=2 times baseline, G2-4 neurologic toxicity, or G3-4 non-hematologic toxicities. Disease evaluations were conducted after every 2 treatment cycles using RECIST criteria. Patients were treated until the progression of disease (PD) or intolerability. Samples were collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Having established the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), the safety profile and antitumor activity of the RP2D of AB-complex were further examined in patients with either previously treated EC or OC. Result(s): Nine women were enrolled (5 with EC and 4 with OC) in the dose escalation cohort, 3 to each dose level, as no DLTs were observed. All 9 patients have discontinued treatment. Reasons for discontinuation included PD (5 pts), adverse reactions (3 pts.), and patient choice (1 pt.). The median number of cycles administered was 5 (2-14). The most common severe (G3/4) toxicities included neutropenia (44.4%) and leukopenia (22.2%). There have been 5 partial responses ([PR] 55.5%): 1 on DL1 and 2 each on DL2 and DL3. Two patients are alive without PD, 3 alive with PD, and 4 dead following PD. The median time to PD was 1.1 years, and the 18-month overall survival rate was 77.8%. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that AB160 allowed 50% higher paclitaxel dosing and that paclitaxel was cleared in a manner commonly observed with therapeutic antibodies. Based on these findings, 6 EC and 6 OC patients were enrolled and treated at DL2. One OC patient lacks treatment data, having just enrolled. Of the remaining 11 patients, treatment had been discontinued by all 6 EC patients and 1 OC patient. Reasons included PD (EC: 4; OC: 1) and adverse events (EC: 2). The median number of treatment cycles was 4 (range: 1-11) for the EC cohort and unreached for the OC cohort. The most common severe (G3/4) toxicities included leukopenia (EC: 83.3%; OC: 20%), neutropenia (EC: 50%; OC: 40%), lymphopenia (EC: 33.3%), anemia (EC: 33.3%; OC: 20%), hyponatremia (EC: 16.7%; OC: 40%) and fatigue (EC: 33.3%). There were 2 PR in the EC and 1 in the OC cohorts. All 6 EC patients have had PD, with the median PFS being 5.3 months. Conclusion(s): AB160 therapy is safe and demonstrates promising clinical activity in patients with previously treated metastatic gynecologic malignancies. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that AB160 functions as an antibody-drug conjugate. This study was supported by Sorrento Therapeutics.Copyright © 2023

N2  -  Objectives: We examined the efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel (ab-paclitaxel) in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma. Method(s): In this study, 44 patients progressing within 6 months after prior platinum-based treatment were planned to be enrolled. Patients received ab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 30 min every 3 weeks and oral TKI inhibitor anlotinib (10 mg, qd, for 14 days, every 3 weeks) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. For efficacy evaluation, the following was required: measurable disease defined by RECIST 1.1, or if there were no measurable lesions but an elevated CA-125 with significant symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or pleural effusion/ascites (Rustin criteria). The primary endpoint was the investigator-confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Result(s): From January 2021 to May 2022, twenty patients were enrolled with a median age of 52 years (range: 43-66), with 17 patients having measurable lesions. The baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. Among these patients, 16 patients were evaluable, with complete response (CR) in 1 patient, partial response (PR) in 9, stable disease in 6, and progressive disease (PD) zero. The ORR was 62.5% (95% CI: 38.6-81.5), and the DCR was 100% (95% CI: 80.6-100). The median PFS and OS were not reached. The frequent treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) were rash (18.3%), gum pain (11.7%), and decreased white blood cell count (9.9%). Four patients experienced grade >= 3 adverse effects (AEs). The commonly reported grade >= 3 AEs were hematologic. Conclusion(s): Our data showed that anlotinib plus ab-paclitaxel have promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicity profiles in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma.Copyright © 2023

N2  -  The efficacy of a single clinical nanodrug for cancer treatment is still unsatisfactory, especially for drug-resistant cancer. Herein, we applied a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) approach via dietary intervention to assist single clinical nanodrug for breast or ovarian cancer treatments instead of using multi-drug therapies which might cause adverse side effects. Specifically, we adopted Doxil or Abraxane to treat human breast tumor-bearing nude mice and Doxil to treat the human ovarian tumor and drug-resistant ovarian tumor-bearing nude mice under FMD conditions, respectively. According to the results, the FMD condition can promote the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of a single nanodrug, reduce the ATP level in drug-resistant tumor cells to hinder drug efflux, normalize tumor blood vessels, relieve tumor hypoxia, and increase the accumulation of nanodrugs at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effects on these types of human cancers. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the FMD strategy of significance can become a practical, alternative, and promising assistant for single nanodrug for enhancing cancer therapy and clinical translation.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus platinum as first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer (OC). Method(s): Patients administered platinum combined with nab-paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy for epithelial OC, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer from July 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Adverse events (AEs) were examined. Subgroup analysis was performed. Result(s): Seventy-two patients (median age, 54.5 years; range, 20.0-79.0 years) were evaluated, including 12 and 60 administered neoadjuvant therapy and primary surgery with subsequent chemotherapy, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 25.6 months, and the median PFS was 26.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]=24.0-29.3) months in the whole patient population. In the neoadjuvant subgroup, the median PFS was 26.7 (95% CI=22.9- 30.5) months vs. 30.1 (95% CI=23.1-37.1) months in the primary surgery subgroup. Twenty-seven patients were administered nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin and had a median PFS of 30.3 (95% CI=not available [NA]-NA) months. The commonest grade 3-4 AEs included anemia (15.3%), white blood cell decreased (11.1%), and neutrophil count decreased (20.8%). No drug-related hypersensitivity reactions occurred. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel plus platinum as first-line treatment in OC was associated with a favorable prognosis and was tolerable in patients with OC.Copyright © 2023.

N2  -  Aim: We aimed to analyze efficacy and adverse events for nano-bound paclitaxel in cancer treatment, which remain controversial. Method(s): We obtained relevant previously published studies and extracted data on the efficacy and adverse events of nano-bound paclitaxel. Fifteen randomized clinical trials were included. Result(s): Nanoparticle albumin-bound (Nab-) paclitaxel was beneficial in terms of objective response rate (odds ratio [OR]: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.72-1.62) and partial response (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.89-1.83), while polymeric micellar (PM-) paclitaxel was beneficial in terms of objective response rate (OR: 1.76) and partial disease (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.65). Both Nab-paclitaxel and PM-paclitaxel resulted in slightly longer overall survival (HR: 0.93 and 0.94) and progression-free survival (HR: 0.93 and 0.87) when compared with solvent-based paclitaxel. Peripheral sensory neuropathy (OR: 3.47), neutropenia (OR: 1.79) and anemia (OR: 1.79) were more frequent after Nab-paclitaxel treatment. Conclusion(s): Nanopaclitaxel formulations have a better efficacy in cancer treatment; however, they increase the risk of hematological adverse events and peripheral sensory neuropathy. The PM-paclitaxel treatment had a high safety effect. Plain language summary This was a pooled analysis of the efficacy and adverse events of nano-bound paclitaxel (polymeric micellar [PM] or nanoparticle-bound formulation) in cancer treatment. Relevant studies published since 2016 were retrieved from the PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Embase databases. Fifteen randomized clinical trials (4925 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-paclitaxel) had beneficial effects in terms of objective response rate and partial response, while PM-paclitaxel exhibited beneficial effects in terms of objective response rate and partial disease. Both Nab-paclitaxel and PM-paclitaxel were associated with a slightly longer overall survival and better progression-free survival when compared with solvent-based paclitaxel. Peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia and anemia adverse events were more frequent after Nab-paclitaxel treatment. The nanopaclitaxel formulation had an improved efficacy in treatment of solid-organ tumors, but it increased the risk of hematological adverse events and peripheral sensory neuropathy. This study provided evidence on the efficacy and safety of the nanocarriers of paclitaxel.Copyright © 2023 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate the effect of four taxane drugs, namely, paclitaxel, docetaxel, paclitaxel liposomes (Lipusu), and nab-paclitaxel (Keaili) on ovarian cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Method(s): BALB/c-nu/nu female mice were used to develop mouse xenograft models. The mice were randomized to 5 groups (4 in each group), namely, control (PBS) group, paclitaxel group, docetaxel group, liposomal paclitaxel group and nab-paclitaxel group. The effect of four taxane drugs were determined via cell proliferation and toxicity tests. Mouse xenograft models were employed to assess the efficacy of four taxane drugs in inhibiting tumor growth. Result(s): Nab-paclitaxel has a significant ovarian growth-reducing effect in vitro. In vivo, no significant differences were observed in tumor volume among the four groups (p < 0.05). Nab-paclitaxel produced the lowest animal toxicity when compared with other three drugs as the mice in nab-paclitaxel treatment group showed no significant alterations in body weight (p < 0.05). Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining revealed the lowest degree of liver tissue damage in mice treated with nab-paclitaxel compared to mice administered the other three paclitaxels. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel is more effective in mice with ovarian cancer than traditional paclitaxels. Thus, it promises to offer a viable alternative as first-line chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer in humans, as it has low systemic toxicity and fewer hypersensitivity reactions. However, further investigations, including clinical trials in humans, are required.Copyright © 2023 The authors.

N2  -  Objective: The combination of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX)/paclitaxel (PTX) with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has demonstrated significant efficacy in cancer patients. However, the safety of these combination regimens remains conflicting in former researches. Therefore, in order to address this issue, we performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate and compare the safety profile. Method(s): We performed a systematic review by searching randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science up to August 15, 2022. The primary outcomes were all-grade (grade 1-5) and high-grade (grade 3-5) immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Secondary outcomes were all-grade (grade 1-5) and high-grade (grade 3-5) irAEs of subgroups of ICIs. Result(s): There were 22 RCTs included in the NMA, involving a total of 15 963 patients diagnosed with any type of cancer. ICIs+nab-PTX was associated with a noticeably decreased risk of grade 3-5 pneumonitis (odds ratio [OR]=0.28, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.09,0.90) compared to ICI monotherapy; ICIs+PTX showed a lower risk of grade 1-5 hyperthyroidism (OR=0.46, 95% CrI: 0.22-0.96) and grade 1-5 hypothyroidism (OR=0.49, 95% CrI: 0.26-0.93) than ICIs. Compared with PD-1, PD-1+PTX was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of grade 1-5 pneumonitis (OR=0.32, 95% CrI: 0.11-0.92). PD-L1 resulted in a noticeably lower risk of grade 1-5 hypothyroidism (OR=0.34, 95% CrI: 0.12-1.00) than PD-L1+PTX. Nearly all treatment regimens containing ICIs demonstrated significantly higher risks of irAEs compared to the standard chemotherapy groups. Conclusion(s): Nab-PTX/PTX+ICIs demonstrated an approach leading to decreased risk of irAEs compared with ICI monotherapy. This finding supports that ICIs+nab-PTX/PTX may be a safer treatment strategy. Moreover, we also found that the combination regimens containing ICIs had a higher risk of irAEs than standard chemotherapy. Additionally, ICIs+nab-PTX demonstrated a decreased risk of irAEs compared to ICIs+PTX. PD-1 inhibitors were associated with a higher risk of irAEs than PD-L1 inhibitors.Copyright © 2023 Hao, Zhang, Wang, Fang, Jin, Yuan and Cai.

N2  -  Objective. This study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Methods. A total of 84 patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated in our hospital from May 2017 to June 2018 were selected as the research objects. The patients were divided into observation group (n=42) and control group (n=42) according to random number table method. The observation group was treated with olaparib combined with bevacizumab, while the control group was treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab, and the clinical efficacy of the two groups was observed. The levels of serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), and epididymal protein 4 (HE4) were determined. The levels of miRNA124, mirNA-21, and miRNA-203 in the two groups were detected. The incidence of adverse reactions was compared between the two groups. The quality of life of the two groups was assessed using FACT-G scale. The drug safety of the two groups was observed. All patients were followed up for 3 years, and the survival time of the two groups was recorded. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival of the two groups. Results. The overall response rate (ORR) (69.05%) and disease control rate (DCR) (88.10%) of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (40.48% and 66.67%), and the differences were statistically significant (both P<0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum CA125, CA199, HE4, miRNA124, miRNA-21, and miRNA-203 and the improvement degree of quality of life score in the observation group were greater than those in the control group, with statistical significances (all P<0.05).The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates of the observation group (97.62%, 88.10%, and 80.95%) were higher than those of the control group (71.43%, 57.14%, and 47.62%), with statistical significances (all P>0.05). Conclusion. PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab had good effect in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma and can effectively improve the survival time and quality of life of patients.Copyright © 2022 Li Sun et al.

N2  -  Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Method(s): We performed a single institution retrospective review of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were treated with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel from 2012 to 2018 at the Mayo Clinic in Florida. Result(s): Twenty patients were identified and the median PFS for patients treated with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was 9 months (95% CI, 5.7-20.7). Overall, 17 of the 20 patients (85%) achieved a clinical benefit (complete response 5%, partial response 55%, or stable disease at 3 months 25%). For platinum-sensitive disease and platinum-resistant disease, the median OS were 38.7 months (95% CI, 5.8-63.1) and 31.2 months (95% CI, 12.8-51.8), respectively (p = 0.4306). Conclusion(s): This well-tolerated regimen shows promising activity in recurrent ovarian cancer and is a viable option for patients who are intolerant to paclitaxel or carboplatin because of allergic reactions.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  -  Mutation of BRCA2, a breast cancer susceptibility gene, is associated with the development of breast and ovarian cancer. Olaparib is an oral poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which has been proven to treat BRCA-mutated tumors effectively, especially breast and ovarian cancer. Here, we report a case of a germline BRCA2-mutated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, responded well to olaparib. A 41-year-old man with no history of smoking was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with bevacizumab, pemetrexed disodium, and cis-platinum in the first-line therapy of 6 months, followed by bevacizumab, Abraxane, and sintilimab treatments for another 6 months. As disease progression was confirmed and the presence of germline BRCA2 mutation, the combinational treatment of olaparib/anlotinib was applied to achieve partial response 1 month later, and the progression-free survival was extended for another 5 months. This study shows metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with BRCA2 mutation could also respond well to PARP inhibitor, broadening the spectrum of BRCA-mutated cancers suitable for olaparib therapy. With acquired resistance to chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and immunotherapy, the patient still gained significant benefits from the targeted therapy.Copyright © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

N2  -  There is substantial evidence that albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is effective and safe for the treatment of breast, lung and pancreatic cancers. However, it can still cause adverse effects by affecting cardiac enzymes, hepatic enzyme metabolism and blood routine related indicators, which affects the use of chemotherapy for a full course of treatment. However, there are no relevant clinical studies to systematically observe the effects and dynamics of albumin-bound paclitaxel on cardiac enzymes, liver enzyme metabolism, and routine blood-related indices. The purpose of our study was to determine the levels of serum creatinine (Cre), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), white blood cells (WBC) and hemoglobin (HGB) in cancer patients treated with albumin-conjugated paclitaxel. This study retrospectively analyzed 113 patients with cancer. Patients who had received two cycles of nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 (administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle) were selected. Serum Cre, AST, ALT, LDH, CK, and CK-MB activities, WBC counts, and HGB levels were measured before and after treatment with two cycles. Fourteen cancer types were analyzed. The distribution of cancer types in patients was mainly concentrated in lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. Nab-paclitaxel treatment markedly decreased Cre, AST, LDH, and CK activities in the serum and WBC counts and HGB levels, respectively. Serum Cre and CK activities and HGB levels were remarkably downregulated at baseline compared to healthy controls. Patients receiving nab-paclitaxel treatment cause metabolic disorders in tumor patients by reducing the decrease of Cre, AST, LDH, CK, CK-MB, WBC and HGB indexes, thus inducing the occurrence of cardiovascular events, hepatotoxic events and fatigue and other symptoms. Therefore, for tumor patients, although receiving nab-paclitaxel improves the anti-tumor effect, it is still necessary to closely monitor the changes of related enzymatic and routine blood indicators, so as to detect and intervene at an early stage.Copyright © 2023.

N2  -  There is a need for therapeutics with novel mechanisms-of-action for patients with advanced solid malignancies. In this first completed part of LOKON002, a phase I/II (NCT03225989) clinical study, the safety and clinical response to LOAd703 in combination with standard-of-care (SoC), or conditioning gemcitabine chemotherapy, was investigated. LOAd703 is an oncolytic adenovirus of serotype 5/35 modified to express two immunostimulatory transgenes, trimerized membrane-bound CD40L and 4-1BBL. In the completed part I (phase I and IIa) of the study, eligible patients with advanced pancreatic-, colorectal-, biliary-and ovarian cancer, were treated with increasing doses of LOAd703 (5 x 1010, 1 x 1011 and 5 x 1011 viral particles) using a standard 3+3 design. LOAd703 was administered intratumorally (ultrasound-guided) for up to 8 bi-weekly injections. The maximum tolerated dose tested was further evaluated in an extended dose cohort to confirm safety and assess preliminary clinical activity, and to select the best two indications for the part II of the study. Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in part I presented herein. Fifteen of these received LOAd703 combined with SoC, and thirteen in combination with conditioning gemcitabine. The most frequently reported treatment-or procedure-related adverse events were fever (82% of patients), chills (54%) and fatigue (43%). Four patients developed transient cytokine release syndrome. Twenty-five patients fulfilled the criteria to be evaluable for efficacy, which required receiving at least 3 doses of LOAd703 and results from a CT scan week 9. Partial response (PR) was achieved in two patients with pancreatic cancer treated at the highest LOAd703 dose level in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. One of the PRs was achieved at week 25, and the patient received one additional month of chemotherapy per protocol. This patient remained treatment-free for 17 months before chemotherapy was restarted due to progression, and was still alive at last follow-up 34 months after the study registration date. The other PR was achieved at week 17, two weeks after the last LOAd703 injection; disease progression was evident at week 33 and OS was 21 months. Three patients experienced stable disease for a minimum of 25 weeks. This included a patient with advanced ovarian cancer who showed SD at least until week 40, and had an OS of 40 months. No association between adverse events and response was identified. Anti-adenoviral antibody levels (IgG), which increased in all patients, could not be related to indices of clinical benefit. Based on the safety of LOAd703 at all dose levels studied, as well as evidence of objective clinical activity in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, further disease-directed studies of intratumoral administration of LOAd703 are warranted.

N2  -  Guanylate Binding Protein 1 (GBP1) is known as an interferon gamma induced GTPase. It plays a crucial role in innate immunity against pathogenic infections but its role in cancer and therapeutic response is not well understood. Therefore, to study the role of GBP1, we investigated genetically manipulated ovarian cancer cells. We have employed in vitro and in vivo studies along with a proteomics approach to uncover the protein-protein interactions and their crosstalk with GBP1. The data suggest that GBP1 knockdown (KD) inhibits the clonogenic potential of cancer cells. In vivo studies including subcutaneous xenograft and intraperitoneal models revealed that GBP1 overexpressing (OV) tumor cells growing faster and reduce the median survival of animals compared to vehicle control (VC). Whereas GBP1 KD tumors were progressing slowly with longer median survival compared to scrambled control (SC). To study the molecular interactions of GBP1, we performed a proteomics-based Cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) on GBP1 OV and KD ovarian cancer cells. We found that GBP1 interacts with members of proteasome including PSMB1, PSMB6, PSMA3, and Cytochrome C (CYCS). Protein analysis showed that GBP1 over-expressing cells had less ubiquitinylated proteins compared to VC, whereas GBP1 KD cells accumulate the ubiquitinylated proteins compared to SC. We also found that the GBP1 KD cells are sensitive to paclitaxel treatment and accumulated ubiquitinylated proteins compared to SC. Moreover, GBP1 KD inhibits the overall proteasomal activity. Paclitaxel-treated GBP1 OV cells accumulated the ubiquitination of CYCS, followed by clearance of cytosolic CYCS. Furthermore, global proteome profiling also suggests that GBP1 KD induces apoptotic pathways whereas GBP1 OV induces pathways associated with the stress response. Overall, the results from our studies elucidate the role of GBP1 in chemotherapeutic stress response via the activation of proteasomal machinery.

N2  -  Selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulators (SGRMs) represent a clinically validated mechanism of enhancing chemosensitivity and ameliorating the sequelae of hypercortisolism. While GRs reportedly control the expression of up to 20% of the human genome, specific targets of systemic GR antagonism in humans have yet to be identified. To address this question, we established a robust NanoString assay to measure candidate GR target genes in human blood and assessed them before and after therapy with the oral SGRM relacorilant, which selectively antagonizes the GR. In a randomized, controlled phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinumresistant ovarian cancer (NCT03776812), gene changes were assessed in 139 patients after treatment with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel (NP) or NP alone. Using cross-validated random forest methods, a gene panel that accurately identified patients who had received relacorilant was established (ROC AUC 0.945 +/- 0.038). In 13 patients who crossed over from NP alone to relacorilant + NP, the genes in the panel were modified only after crossover (paired t-test P=0.0003), validating the gene panel's ability to detect GR activity. The 4 most induced (LILRB4, FPR3, CLEC10A, CCR2) and 4 most suppressed (CDKN1C, TNFRSF17, BRIP1, PDK1) genes by relacorilant + NP vs. NP alone were selected and shown to be reliable indicators of GR activity across clinical studies in patients with pancreatic, prostate, and other solid tumors (NCT04329949, NCT03674814, NCT02762981), independent of concomitant medications or other confounders. CLEC10A (C-type lectin domain containing 10A) was identified as a particularly sensitive marker of GR activity as its expression was strongly suppressed by the GR agonist prednisone in healthy volunteers (paired t-test P<0.00010, NCT03335956) and strongly induced by relacorilant in patients with solid tumors (paired t-test P<0.00010). CLEC10A induction in blood by relacorilant was associated with longer overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer treated with relacorilant + NP (HR=0.39, Cox PH P=0.0135). High baseline tumor CLEC10A expression was also associated with longer overall survival in a large tumor 'omics' database (N=1656 ovarian tumors; HR 0.8, log-rank P=0.0008). CLEC10A and the genes correlated with its expression were found to be primarily expressed by a specific subset of dendritic cells, supporting previous reports that GR agonism can suppress dendritic cells. This analysis of CLEC10A and other identified GR target genes confirmed that systemic GR activity in patients with a range of solid tumors can be modulated pharmacologically, indicates that GR modulation may be associated with survival in patients with ovarian cancer, and provides new insights into the systemic functions of the GR in humans.

N2  -  Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a malignant and aggressive tumor whose primary origin is still unknown despite thorough evaluation. CUP can be life-threatening with a median overall survival of less than 1 year based on empirical chemotherapy. Gene detection technology advances the driver gene detection of malignant tumors and the appropriate precise therapy. Immunotherapy has ushered in a new era in cancer therapy, changing the way advanced tumors, including CUP, are treated. Combined with comprehensive clinical and pathological investigations, molecular analysis of the original tissue and detection of potential driver mutations may provide therapeutic recommendations for CUP. Case presentation: A 52-year-old female was admitted to hospital for dull abdominal pain, with peripancreatic lesions below the caudate lobe of the liver and posterior peritoneal lymph nodes enlargement. Conventional biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography and laparoscopic biopsy both revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma based on immunohistochemical series. To help identify tumor origin and molecular characteristics, 90-gene expression assay, tumor gene expression profiling with Next-generation sequencing (NGS) method and Immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 were employed. Although no gastroesophageal lesions discovered by gastroenteroscopy, the 90-gene expression assay yielded a similarity score and prompted the most likely primary site was gastric/esophagus cancer. NGS revealed high TMB (19.3mutations/Mb) but no druggable driver genes identified. The Dako PD-L1 22C3 assay IHC assay for PD-L1 expression revealed a tumor proportion score (TPS) of 35%. Given the presence of negative predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy, including adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) c.646C>T mutation at exon 7 and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), the patient received immunochemotherapy instead of immunotherapy alone. She was successfully treated with nivolumab plus carboplatin and albumin-bound nanoparticle paclitaxel for six cycles and nivolumab maintenance, which achieved a complete response (CR) maintained for 2 years without severe adverse events. Conclusion(s): This case highlights the value of multidisciplinary diagnosis and individual precision treatment in CUP. Further investigation is needed as an individualized treatment approach combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy based on tumor molecular characteristics and immunotherapy predictors is expected to improve the outcome of CUP therapy.Copyright © 2023 Sheng, Pan and Han.

N2  -  Introduction: Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is a treatment option for patients with peritoneal surface malignancies of different origin and a considerable research effort was dedicated to the analysis of its initial results. The drug combinations currently used and approved are PIPAC-DC (doxorubicin 2.1 mg/sm and cisplatin 10.5mg/sm) and PIPAC-Ox (oxaliplatin 92 mg/sm). While there is a consensus about the routine use of these drug regimens, some patients may be resistant to current combinations. Some of the expert centers punctually applied alternative regimens to respond to these personalized patient need. The aim of the present study (Alternat-IP) is to assess the feasibility and safety of the current PIPAC alternative regimens in international centers. Method(s): All the centers identified to use alternative PIPAC drugs at the PIPAC survey were invited to participate in this retrospective study. Out of the 13 identified centers, nine accepted. All cases of PIPAC performed with mitomycin C, irinotecan or any other alternative drugs and/or combinations were. The primary objective was the safety profile of these empirical regimens. Result(s): The nine international expert centers applying alternative PIPAC drug regimens are located in five different countries (Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland and India). Twenty-four cases were submitted to alternative treatment (primary peritoneal cancer n=1; colorectal cancer n=10; appendiceal cancer n = 4; ovarian cancer n=3; gastric cancer n=4; pancreatic cancer n=2). A total of 80 PIPAC procedures were included. Fourteen patients were submitted to PIPAC with mitomycin C (10 patients at a dose of 1.5mg/sm, 2 patients at 14mg/smand 1 at 4 mg/sm) for a total of 43 PIPAC procedures.Nomajor complications were reported; 5 CTCAE grade 2 complications were described (nausea n =2; abdominal pain n= 1; fever n = 1). No toxicities were recorded for PIPAC with Irinotecan at a dose of 20mg/sm(n = 3) or 30mg/sm(n=2), for patients with Nab-paclitaxel 112.5mg/sm (n=3), nor for patients with docetaxel 10 mg/sm + cisplatin 7.5 mg/sm + doxorubicin 1.5 mg/sm (n=2). Two patients were submitted to PIPAC with Paclitaxel 10 mg/sm (5 PIPAC in total) with one CTCAE grade 3 complication (bowel fistula). Conclusion(s): Alternat-IP study allowed us to explore the different alternative drug regimens. PIPAC with mytomicin C 1.5- 4 mg/sm is safe. The use of irinotecan and nab-paclitaxel is feasible and safe. Feasibility and safety of paclitaxel and the triplet of docetaxel+cisplatin+doxorubicin must be confirmed by wider case histories. The results obtained could represent a valid starting point for new phase I studies.

N2  -  Introduction: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of gelatinous material within the abdomen and pelvis. While usually appendiceal in origin, it can be seen with mucinous tumors arising from the ovary, GI tract, urachus, and pancreas. We describe a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed due to the clinical syndrome precipitated by pseudomyxoma peritonei. Case Description/Methods: A 59-year-old Hispanic male presented to the hospital for evaluation due to a 2 month history of poor oral intake and worsening abdominal fullness, distension, discomfort, and intermittent pain. The patient reported one prior hospitalization for pancreatitis of unclear etiology, 3 years ago. A CT abdomen & pelvis was obtained; findings reported include multiple hepatic subcapsular cystic liver lesions, abdominal omental caking, ascites, and extrahepatic biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation without definitive evidence of a mass. CEA and CA 19-9 were found to be elevated at 49.4 and 416 respectively. CT chest revealed a left-sided pleural effusion. Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative. Paracentesis yielded gelatinous ascites. Clinical suspicion for appendiceal malignancy was raised which required surgical exploration and biopsy to confirm. An MRI of the abdomen was obtained to assess for pancreatic mass given presence of double duct sign. MRI revealed 2.2 x 2.7 x 5 cm lesion in the body of the pancreas, pseudomyxoma peritonei with scalloping of the liver and extension into the right posterior mediastinum via the esophageal hiatus, metastatic deposits in the porta hepatis and peritoneal carcinomatosis. No apparent abnormality in the appendix was observed. EUS FNA was performed; splenic vessel invasion by the mass was noted. Cytopathology supported a diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The patient was initiated on palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel which led to a significant reduction in ascites and pleural effusion and improvement in symptoms. Discussion(s): This case highlights the potential of malignancies such as pancreatic adenocarcinoma to cause pseudomyxoma peritonei despite it more commonly being associated with appendiceal origin. Knowledge of this can help guide diagnostic and therapeutic plans.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer is the most malignant gynecological disease, which seriously threatens female physical and mental health. Paclitaxel is a first-line chemotherapy drug in the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer, but drug resistance has become an important factor affecting the survival of ovarian cancer patients. However, the main mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the Integrated Gene Expression Database (GEO) dataset using comprehensive bioinformatics tools to provide new therapeutic strategies and search for prognostic targets for ovarian cancer. Method(s): Ovarian cancer related genes were extracted from GSE18520 by bioinformatics method. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis, and related genes and functions were elucidated. The key gene CRTC2 was identified by prognostic analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of CRTC2 in chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer tissues. Functional analysis (cell assay) confirmed the role of CRTC2 in paclitaxel resistance. Autophagy related proteins were detected by Western blot. Autophagy flux analysis was performed using the GFP/RFP-LC3 adenovirus reporter. Result(s): A total of 3,852 DEGs were identified in the GEO microarray dataset. Key genes were screened by prognostic analysis. We found that CRTC2 was highly expressed in chemoresistant tissues of ovarian cancer. In 110 patients with ovarian cancer, high expression of CRTC2 was associated with poorer prognostic factors and shorter survival. At the same time, we found that CRTC2 can promote the proliferation and invasion ability of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, CRTC2 can affect the expression of PI3K, AKT, autophagic flux and sensitivity to paclitaxel chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Conclusion(s): CRTC2 can affect autophagy partially through PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and then affect the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel chemotherapy. CRTC2 may be a potential predictor or target for ovarian cancer therapy.Copyright © The author(s).

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX), Docetaxel (DTX) and Cabazitaxel (CTX) are taxanes: substances that belong to a class of diterpenes derived from plants of the Taxus genus (yew). Taxanes are currently used in clinical practice for the treatment of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and prostate, among others. Despite their wide applications, taxanes have some disadvantages that can hinder their use as a chemotheraputic, including low solubility, high toxicity and induction of multidrug resistance (MDR). To circumvent the low solubility of PTX, the commercial formulation Taxol contains Cremophor EL (polyethoxylated castor oil) and dehydrated alcohol at a 1:1 ratio to solubilize the drug, but the excipient has toxic effects. In this context, we will discuss how nanotechnology contributes to improving the therapeutic efficacy of taxanes by promoting increased solubility after nanoencapsulation and allowing for co-delivery of taxanes with other chemotherapeutics and/or substances with antitumor potential. Nanosystrems may present passive accumulation of taxanes in cancerous tissues through the increased permeability and retention effect (EPR), thus enhancing therapeutic efficacy in experimental models in vitro and in vivo. In this article, we will present and discuss some conventional nanosystems including: lipid nanoparticles (liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers and nanoemulsions), polymeric nanoparticles (albumin, chitosan, poly lactic-co-glycolic acid, poly epsilon-caprolactone and other polymers) and inorganic nanoparticles (gold, iron and silver), in addition to site-specific drug delivery through the use of nanoparticles conjugated with monoclonal antibodies, peptides, folate and transferrin. Physicochemical aspects (particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency) and biological aspects (cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, in vivo efficacy) of taxane-loaded nanoparticles will be commented on. Next, we will discuss nanosystems that can respond to physical and chemical stimuli in the tumor microenvironment. It is noteworthy that the successes in nanosystem and, more specifically, nanoencapsulation research of taxanes resulted in FDA approval of a PTX-linked albumin nanosystem, Abraxane, in 2005. Finally, several clinical studies have been developed in recent years demonstrating advances and therapeutic benefit, proving the potential of nanocarriers to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy with taxanes.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  A 69-year-old female patient received olaparide 300 mg orally twice daily after 6 cycles of chemotherapy with albumin paclitaxel+carboplatin regimen after cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer. The platelet count (PLT) was 151x109/L before the olaparide treatment, and on the 14th day of medication, her platelet count (PLT) was 17x109/L and platelet-associated immunoglobulin was positive. Immune thrombocytopenia due to olaparib was considered. The patient did not take the drug again. Thrombopoietin, eltrombopag, methylprednisolone, and platelet transfusion were given successively, but the PLT in the patients increased and decreased repeatedly, with the highest being 67x109/L, minimum 4x109/L.Copyright © 2022 Journal of Clinical Hepatology.

N2  -  A 77-year-old female patient was given combined chemotherapy with paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound) and nedaplatin for ovarian malignant tumor with peritoneal metastasis. When paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound) 100 mg dissolved in 0.9% sodium chloride injection 250 ml was given intravenously for the first time, the infusion was not smooth and the drip rate was slow. After stopping infusion, the infusion device was checked and white flocculent sediment above the filter was found. Clinical pharmacists ruled out the possibility of precipitation caused by drug preparation and incompatibility contraindications, and found that the infusion device used by this patient was a precision one (the pore diameter of microporous filter was 5 mum). However, in the drug label of paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound), it was pointed out that "Use of filters with a pore size less than 15 mum may result in blockage of the filter and should not be used." On the second day, a general infusion device (filter with 20 mum pore size) was used for IV infusion of paclitaxel for injection (albumin bound) and the process was smooth and no blockage recurred.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association

N2  -  Determine the association of lean body mass (LBM) on the incidence and severity of peripheral neurotoxicity in cancer patients who received nab-paclitaxel alone or combined with cisplatin or carboplatin. This prospective clinical study examined 32 cancer patients classified into a sarcopenia or non-sarcopenia group according to the Asian L3 vertebra skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI) at Ordos Central Hospital (China) from December 2020-2021, to compare the incidence and severity of neurotoxicity and analizing the relationship between nab-paclitaxel dose per kg LBM and neurotoxicity. There were 18 patients (56.25%) in the sarcopenia group and 14 (43.75%) in the non-sarcopenia group. The incidences of peripheral and severe neurotoxicity were higher in the sarcopenia group (both P < 0.05). Patients in three different body surface area (BSA) groups received the same nab-paclitaxel dose (260 mg/m2 BSA). However, when patients were divided into three groups according to LBM, they received different doses (low-LBM: 15.18 mg/kg LBM, middle-LBM: 12.82 mg/kg LBM, and high-LBM: 11.14 mg/kg LBM). The incidence of grade-C or higher neurotoxicity of these three groups was 61.54% (8/13), 20.00% (1/5), and 11.11% (1/9). Sarcopenia and a higher dose of nab-paclitaxel per kg LBM were associated with peripheral and severe neurotoxicity. Chemotherapy dosing based on body composition may reduce neurotoxicity in patients receiving nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological cancers, with the most advanced disease and poor survival. Although BRCA genes play a key role in maintaining genomic stability and providing the possibility of clinically individualized treatments, with the emergence of new and more appropriate treatment options, new treatment-related adverse events are challenging and difficult for clinicians. Case presentation: An 80-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (CT3cN1MX) with BRCA2 as the causative gene. She underwent three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel 400 mg and carboplatin 450 mg before surgery. Chest HRCT prior to chemotherapy demonstrated bilateral interstitial pneumonia. During chemotherapy, there were four episodes of dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and three episodes of bone marrow suppression. The symptoms became intermittent and progressively worse, and after three sessions of empirical cough and phlegm relief, oxygen inhalation, corticosteroids, anti-infectives, and leukopenia therapy, the symptoms became intermittent and progressively worse. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis came a week after the third round of chemotherapy. After a strong dose of corticosteroids and nintedanib anti-fibrosis therapy, the pulmonary symptoms abated, and intermediate tumor starvation was performed. The combination therapy was subsequently discontinued, and the patient experienced significant relief from pulmonary symptoms. Treatment response was positive following single-agent nab-paclitaxel 400 mg chemotherapy in combination with nintedanib 150 mg anti-fibrosis therapy. Conclusion(s): In this report, we describe a rare case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated with the use of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in ovarian cancer. During treatment, it is necessary to maintain a high level of vigilance for patients with interstitial pneumonia and engage the attention of clinicians to improve medication safety. Early diagnosis and anti-fibrosis therapy can reverse lung damage.Copyright © 2023 Shen, Wen, Lin and Su.

N2  -  Background: To investigate racial disparities among unresectable/metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) patients treated with contemporary chemotherapy regimens at an urban center. Method(s): Retrospective review of all PDA patients treated at a single institution between 2012-2017. Continuous and categorical variables were tested using t-test, Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze survival outcomes. Result(s): One hundred and forty-five patients identified as: White [69], African American (AA, 34), Asian [15], and Other [27]. Fifty-five-point-seven percent of patients received gemcitabine-based therapy vs. 36.6% received fluorouracil (5-FU) based therapy, specifically 26.1% received FOLFIRINOX and 43.7% received gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. In a univariable model, Asians had significantly worse overall survival (OS) than Whites [hazard ratio (HR) 2.74, P=0.013], but there were no OS differences between AA vs. Whites (HR 1.51, P=0.297) nor Other vs. Whites (HR 2.05, P=0.062). On multivariable analysis, Asians had worse OS compared to Whites (HR 2.62, P=0.018), and gemcitabine-based therapy was inferior to 5-FU-based therapy (HR 2.65, P=0.005). There were no OS differences between AA vs. Whites nor Other vs. Whites (HR 1.12, P=0.769 and HR 0.8, P=0.763, respectively). Conclusion(s): In this series of advanced PDA patients treated with contemporary chemotherapy, AA and White patients had comparable outcomes, but Asians had worse OS than White patients.Copyright © Annals of Pancreatic Cancer.

N2  -  Patients with advanced cancer undergo comprehensive genomic profiling in Japan only after treatment options have been exhausted. Patients with a very poor prognosis were not able to undergo profiling tests, resulting in a selection bias called length bias, which makes accurate survival analysis impossible. The actual impact of length bias on the overall survival of patients who have undergone profiling tests is unclear, yet appropriate methods for adjusting for length bias have not been developed. To assess the length bias in overall survival, we established a simulation-based model for length bias adjustment. This study utilized clinicogenomic data of 8813 patients with advanced cancer who underwent profiling tests at hospitals throughout Japan between June 2019 and April 2022. Length bias was estimated by the conditional Kendall tau statistics and was significantly positive for 13 of the 15 cancer subtypes, suggesting a worse prognosis for patients who underwent profiling tests in early timing. The median overall survival time in colorectal, breast, and pancreatic cancer from the initial survival-prolonging chemotherapy with adjustment for length bias was 937 (886-991), 1225 (1152-1368), and 585 (553-617) days, respectively (median; 95% credible interval). Adjusting for length bias made it possible to analyze the prognostic relevance of oncogenic mutations and treatments. In total, 12 tumor-specific oncogenic mutations correlating with poor survival were detected after adjustment. There was no difference in survival between FOLFIRINOX (leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel-treated groups as first-line chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Adjusting for length bias is an essential part of utilizing real-world clinicogenomic data.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  -  The taxanes are effective microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapy drugs that inhibit mitosis, induce apoptosis, and produce regression in a fraction of cancers that arise at many sites including the ovary. Novel therapeutic targets that augment taxane effects are needed to improve clinical chemotherapy response in CCNE1-amplified high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells. In this study, we conducted an siRNA-based kinome screen to identify modulators of mitotic progression in CCNE1-amplified HGSOC cells that may influence clinical paclitaxel response. PLK1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer, which correlates with poor prognosis. Here, we identified a novel synthetic lethal interaction of the clinical PLK1 inhibitor BI6727 and the microtubuletargeting drug paclitaxel in HGSOC cell lines with CCNE1-amplification and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of this synergism. BI6727 synergistically induces apoptosis together with paclitaxel in different cell lines including a patient-derived primary ovarian cancer culture. Moreover, the inhibition of PLK1 reduced the paclitaxelinduced neurotoxicity in a neurite outgrowth assay. Mechanistically, the combinatorial treatment with BI6727/paclitaxel triggers mitotic arrest, which initiates mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, followed by significant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-dependent effector pathways. This conclusion is supported by data showing that BI6727/ paclitaxel-co-treatment stabilizes FBW7, a component of SCF-type ubiquitin ligases that bind and regulate key modulators of cell division and growth including MCL-1 and Cyclin E. This identification of a novel synthetic lethality of PLK1 inhibitors and a microtubule-stabilizing drug has important implications for developing PLK1 inhibitorbased combination treatments in CCNE1-amplified HGSOC cells.Copyright © Noack et al.

N2  -  Background: The impact of stroma-targeting therapy on tumor immune suppression is largely unexplored. An RNA oligonucleotide, STNM01, has been shown to repress carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 (CHST15) responsible for tumor proteoglycan synthesis and matrix remodeling. This phase I/IIa study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of STNM01 in patients with unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Method(s): This was an open-label, dose-escalation study of STNM01 as second-line therapy in gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel-refractory PDAC. A cycle comprised three 2-weekly endoscopic ultrasound-guided locoregional injections of STNM01 at doses of 250, 1,000, 2,500, or 10,000 nM in combination with S-1 (80-120 mg twice a day for 14 days every 3 weeks). The primary outcome was the incidence of dose-liming toxicity (DLT). The secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), tumor response, changes in tumor microenvironment on immunohistopathology, and safety (jRCT2031190055). Finding(s): A total of 22 patients were enrolled, and 3 cycles were repeated at maximum; no DLT was observed. The median OS was 7.8 months. The disease control rate was 77.3%; 1 patient showed complete disappearance of visible lesions in the pancreas and tumor-draining lymph nodes. Higher tumoral CHST15 expression was associated with poor CD3+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration at baseline. STNM01 led to a significant reduction in CHST15, and increased tumor-infiltrating CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in combination with S-1 at the end of cycle 1. Higher fold increase in CD3+ T cells correlated with longer OS. There were 8 grade 3 adverse events. Interpretation(s): Locoregional injection of STNM01 was well tolerated in patients with unresectable PDAC as combined second-line therapy. It prolonged survival by enhancing T cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment. Funding(s): The present study was supported by theJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED).Copyright © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  -  Introduction: Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (HaT) is an established modifier of anaphylaxis and mast cell mediator-associated symptoms. We present a case of HaT diagnosed after hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutic agents treated with a prolonged desensitization protocol. Case Description: A 56-year-old female with high-grade serous ovarian cancer presented after a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel with an event tryptase of 87.2 ng/mL. She subsequently tolerated nab-paclitaxel and was transitioned to liposomal doxorubicin therapy. During the first infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, she developed gastrointestinal pain, flushing, and hypotension. Despite re-administration via 3-bag, 13-step desensitization, the patient again experienced similar symptoms. A baseline tryptase level was elevated at >30 ng/mL. She had no symptoms in between anaphylactic events, and had previously experienced multiple insect stings without adverse reaction. A bone marrow biopsy was negative for mastocytosis. Genetic testing showed extra-allelic copies of TPSAB1 consistent with HaT. She subsequently tolerated liposomal doxorubicin via slowed 4-bag, 17-step desensitization protocol and seven days of premedication with cetirizine, cromolyn, montelukast, and famotidine. After multiple cycles, her imaging showed improvement in peritoneal carcinomatosis. However, she also developed a new reaction to iodinated contrast media which she had previously tolerated. Despite a similar premedication regimen and use of non-ionic, iso-osmolar contrast media, she experienced recurrent contrast-induced anaphylaxis. Omalizumab is being pursued as a potential treatment for preventing anaphylaxis. Discussion(s): This patient with hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapy agents and iodinated contrast was found to have underlying HaT. The use of a slowed desensitization protocol and multi-day premedication regimen allowed for treatment of her malignancy.Copyright © 2022

N2  -  BAP1 cancer syndrome is a rare and highly penetrant hereditary cancer predisposition. Uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and cutaneous melanoma are considered BAP1 cancer syndrome core cancers, whereas association with breast cancer has previously been suggested but not confirmed so far. In view of BAP1 immunomodulatory functions, BAP1 alterations could prove useful as possible biomarkers of response to immunotherapy in patients with BAP1-associated cancers. We present a case of a patient with BAP1 cancer syndrome who developed a metastatic breast cancer with loss of BAP1 demonstrated on immunohistochemistry. She carried a germline BAP1 likely pathogenic variant (c.898_899delAG p.(Arg300Glyfs*6)). In addition, tumor tissue sequencing identified a concurrent somatic variant in BAP1 (partial deletion of exon 12) and a low tumor mutational burden. As her triple negative tumor was shown to be PD-L1 positive, the patient was treated with combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel. She had a complete and sustained response to immunotherapy even after discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel. This case strengthens the evidence for including breast cancer in the BAP1 cancer syndrome tumor spectrum with implications for future cancer prevention programs. It also indicates immune checkpoint inhibitors might prove to be an effective treatment for BAP1-deficient breast cancer.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  -  Objectives This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-p) combined with carboplatin as a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) regimen for patients with ovarian cancer (OC). Methods This is a single-center, open phase Ib/II Clinical Trial (ChiCTR1900026893). We enrolled women with unresectable epithelial OC, FIGO stage III or IV. Patients received 3 cycles of NACT, then interval debulking surgery (IDS), followed by 3-6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Each 3-week cycle consisted of carboplatin AUC5 plus nab-p 260 mg/m2 (Keaili). In the phase Ib part, the objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the NACT. In the phase II part, the primary objective was R0 resection rate. Secondary objectives were progression-free survival, objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Results Phase Ib results showed the NACT was safe and tolerable, so the study proceeded to phase II. A total of 22 patients were included in this analysis, 10 patients in the phase Ib and 12 patients in the phase II. The median age was 58.5 years and 13 (59.1%) patients had stage IIIC. After NACT, the ORR was 86.4% (95%CI: 65.1%-97.1%). Among the 20 patients who underwent IDS, all patients achieved optimal debulking and 75% (95%CI: 50.9%-91.3%) achieved R0 resection. During NACT, the most common grade 3/4 adverse events were hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia (81.8%), leucopenia (54.5%), anaemia (22.7%) and thrombocytopenia (22.7%). All adverse events returned to normal or acceptable levels after receiving appropriate treatment. Conclusions Nab-p plus carboplatin as a NACT regimen was effective and tolerable for unresectable epithelial OC.

N2  -  Objectives This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of short-course regimen of nab-paclitaxel (Keaili) plus carboplatin (Nab-PC) and standard chemotherapy of paclitaxel plus carboplatin (PC) for ovarian cancer (ChiCTR1900028165). Methods In this phase II study, women with stage II to IV epithelial ovarian cancer were assigned to Nab-PC group (4 cycles of nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks) or PC group (6 cycles of paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 plus carboplatin AUC5 every 3 weeks) according to patient's choice. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were objective response rate, overall survival and safety. Results Only 17 patients in Nab-PC group were included in this preliminary analysis. The median age was 54 years. 10 patients were evaluable for response according to GCIG CA125 criteria, the objective response rate was 100%. A study of PC as first-line chemotherapy showed CA125 response was 76.8% (J Natl Cancer Inst 2004;96:1682-91). With a median follow-up of 7.36 months, one patient developed progressive disease 21.26 months after enrollment. Compared with the above-mentioned PC study, we found a lower incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia (11.76% vs 84%) and thrombocytopenia (0.00% vs 10%) and with a similar incidence of anemia (11.76% vs 8%). Conclusions Preliminary results suggested that for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer the short-course Nab-PC regimen as first-line chemotherapy provided equivalent efficacy to that of the PC regimen and there appeared to be a lower incidence of hematologic toxicities.

N2  -  Objectives We examined the efficacy and safety of combining anlotinib with albumin-bound)paclitaxel (ab-paclitaxel) in patients with recurrent,platinum-resistant ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma. Methods In this study,44 patients progressing within 6 months after prior platinum-based treatment, were planned to be enrolled. Patients received ab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 30 min every 3 weeks and oral TKI inhibitor anlotinib (10 mg, qd, for 14 days,every 3 weeks) until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. For efficacy evalution, the following were required: measurable disease defined by RECIST 1.1, or if there were no measurable lesions but an elevated CA125 with significant symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, or pleural effusion/ascites (Rustin criteria). The primary end point were investigator-confirmed objective response rate (ORR). Results From January 2021 to May 2022, twenty patients were enrolled with a median age of 52 years(range, 43-66). seventeen patients had measurable lesions. The baseline characteristics were listed in table 1. Among these patients, sixteen patient were evaluable, including complete response (CR) in one patients, partial response (PR) nine, stable disease six, and progressive disease (PD) zero. The ORR was 62.5% (95% CI, 38.6 to 81.5), the DCR was 100% (95% CI,80.6 to 100). The median PFS and OS was not reached. The frequent TRAEs were rash (18.3%), gum-pain (11.7%), and decreased white blood cell count (9.9%). four patients experienced grade >=3 AEs. The commonly reported grade >=3 AEs were hematologic. Conclusions Our data showed that anlotinib plus ab-paclitaxe have promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicity profile in patients with recurrent,platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma.

N2  -  Objectives Single-agent chemotherapy is a mainstay of platinum- resistant ovarian cancer treatment. However, most patients eventually face chemotherapy resistance, which might be driven by endogenous cortisol suppressing apoptotic pathways utilized by chemotherapies. A phase 2 study of nab-paclitaxel (NP) with/without the glucocorticoid receptor modulator relacorilant (RELA) in patients with ovarian cancer showed improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response (DOR) with addition of RELA. We present a post-hoc subgroup analysis in patients with/without prior bevacizumab. Methods 178 women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with <=4 prior lines of chemotherapy (105 with; 73 without prior bevacizumab) were enrolled in a phase 2, open-label, randomized study (NCT03776812). Data for patients receiving either NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) (n=60) or NP alone (100 mg/m2) (n=60) are reported. Results Baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were generally balanced. While patients without prior bevacizumab were balanced between North America and Europe, 70% of patients who received prior bevacizumab were in Europe. PFS, OS, ORR, and DOR are shown in table 1. Conclusions In this subgroup analysis, patients who had received prior bevacizumab had better PFS, OS, and DOR with intermittent RELA+NP vs NP alone, while ORR was similar across all groups. Numerical improvement in PFS was seen in patients without prior bevacizumab. Prior bevacizumab will be a stratification factor in the phase 3 trial of RELA +NP (ROSELLA, NCT05257408) that is planned to start in mid-2022.

N2  -  During a screening performed by the National Cancer Institute in the 1960s, the terpenoid paclitaxel was discovered. Paclitaxel expanded the treatment options for breast, lung, prostate and ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel is only present in minute amounts in the bark of Taxia brevifolia. A sustainable supply was ensured with a culture developed from Taxus chinensis, or with semi-synthesis from other taxanes. Paclitaxel is marketed under the name Taxol. An intermediate from the semi-synthesis docetaxel is also used as a drug and marketed as Taxotere. O-Methylated docetaxel is used for treatment of some paclitaxel-resistant cancer forms as cabazitaxel. The solubility problems of paclitaxel have been overcome by formulation of a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (NAB-paclitaxel, Abraxane). The mechanism of action is affinity towards microtubules, which prevents proliferation and consequently the drug would be expected primarily to be active towards cancer cells proliferating faster than benign cells. The activity against slowly growing tumors such as solid tumors suggests that other effects such as oncogenic signaling or cellular trafficking are involved. In addition to terpenoids, recently discovered microtubule-targeting polyketide macrolides and non-ribosomal peptides have been discovered and marketed as drugs. The revolutionary improvements for treatment of cancer diseases targeting microtubules have led to an intensive search for other compounds with the same target. Several polyketide macrolides, terpenoids and non-ribosomal peptides have been investigated and a few marketed.

N2  -  Purpose: Optimal first-line chemotherapy regimens are crucial for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treatment. Nab-paclitaxel has showed its considerable survival and low toxicity profiles in first-line treatment for three solid tumors and is recommended as a treatment for recurrent EOC. We focus on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of nab-paclitaxel in current clinical studies of EOC treatment and aim to explore the potential feasibility of nab-paclitaxel as the first-line treatment for EOC. Method(s): We searched for eligible studies up to January 2020 in Pubmed. Outcomes of interests included drug regimes, objective response rate (ORR), median progression free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS) and main adverse events to determine feasibility of nab-paclitaxel. Result(s): This review included nine eligible studies. One study about nab-paclitaxel with carboplatin as first-line therapy in ten cases after hypersensitivity to paclitaxel had an ORR of 100%, median PFS of 16.7 months and median OS of 65.4 months. Evidence of nab-paclitaxel activity in platinum-sensitive EOC demonstrated an ORR of 64%, a median time to response of 1.3 months and PFS of 8.5 months. The ORR, median PFS and median OS range in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant EOC from 23%-72%, 4.0-8.5 months, 16.8-17.4 months, respectively. All studies demonstrated manageable toxicity profile in EOC patients. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel presents potentials as the first-line chemotherapy for considerable survival and safety in EOC compared to conventional paclitaxel. However, there is no prospective trial in EOC so far. Therefore, more studies about nab-paclitaxel are needed.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel is a microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic agent. Despite its widespread use, it damages healthy tissues such as skin. The goal of this study was to prove that the real impact of paclitaxel-induced skin toxicity could be underestimated because the adverse events might appear asymptomatic. Method(s): Gynecological cancer patients were recruited. Skin parameters measurements were taken after three and six paclitaxel cycles. Measurements were conducted using specific probes which measure hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum, elasticity and firmness, erythema, roughness, smoothness, skin thickness, and desquamation levels. Further, a 3D epidermis model was incubated with paclitaxel to analyze gene and protein expression of aquaporin 3, collagen type 1, elastin, and fibronectin. Result(s): Paclitaxel induced alterations in the skin parameters with no visible clinical manifestations. Gynecological cancer patients under paclitaxel treatment had a decrease in hydration, TEWL, sebum, elasticity, and thickness of the skin, while erythema, roughness, and desquamation were increased. The molecular markers, related to hydration and the support of the skin layers, and analyzed in the 3D epidermis model, were decreased. Conclusion(s): Results suggest that paclitaxel modifies gene and protein expression of skin-related molecular markers, and impairs different physical, physiological, and biomechanical properties of the skin of cancer patients at a subclinical level.Copyright © 2022 by the authors.

N2  -  Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a fatal disease with a high mortality rate due to difficulties in early diagnosis and metastasis. Common sites of metastasis from PC include the liver, lung, stomach and kidney. Patients diagnosed at already the metastatic stages on presentation constitute 50-55% of the cases, with a 5-year survival rate of 3%. By contrast, secondary ovarian metastases account for 10-25% of all ovarian malig- nancies, though an accurate diagnosis remain challenging. The present study reports the rare case of a 42-year-old woman with primary hepatic metastasis and secondary ovarian metastasis from PC treated with two lines of immunotherapy, who is also experiencing severe treatment-associated toxicity. The patient first received combined immunotherapy consisting of camreli- zumab (200 mg; day 1; every 3 weeks) and chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2; days 1 and 8; every 3 weeks) and gemcitabine (1, 000 mg/m2; days 1 and 8; every 3 weeks). She then exhibited a partial response following 4 months of treat- ment. However, 9 months after the initial treatment, the disease progressed with ovarian involvement, which was confirmed by surgery. Second-line treatment included immunotherapy, targeted therapy and oral chemotherapy (200 mg sintilimab on day 1; 50 mg tegafur from days 1-14, twice daily; and 8 mg anlotinib from days 1-14, every 3 weeks). The progression-free survival time from this second-line treatment was 6 months.Copyright © 2022 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Introduction: LCL161 is a novel oral pan-inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist. LCL161 enhances paclitaxel activity in cell lines and xenograft models. A phase I study of LCL161 combined with paclitaxel for the treatment of Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors was conducted. Method(s): Each patient received oral LCL161 in a single weekly dose on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21-day treatment cycle. In the second cycle, patients received a combination treatment with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) whenever possible. A Bayesian logistic regression model by escalation with the overdose control principle was used. Result(s): Nine patients were treated with LCL161 at a dose of 600 mg (five patients) or 1200 mg (four patients). Seven patients were treated with LCL161 plus paclitaxel, and two patients received only LCL161 monotherapy. Because this study was terminated early due to a change in the LCL161 development strategy, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined. One patient treated with LCL161 monotherapy at a dose of 1200 mg experienced dose limitind toxicity (grade 3 maculopapular rash). Another patient died on day 86 of bacterial pneumonia, which was suspected to be related to the study treatment. The most common serious adverse events were infections and infestations (n = 3). Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that the risk of infection may increase when LCL161 is combined with paclitaxel, but other conclusions about the MTD, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary activity of the combination of LCL161 plus paclitaxel were not drawn.Copyright © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

N2  -  Purpose: Chemotherapy resistance remains a major problem in many solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. Glucocorticoids are one potential driver of chemotherapy resistance as they can mediate tumor progression via induction of cell-survival pathways. We investigated whether combining the selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulator relacorilant with taxanes can enhance antitumor activity. Patients and Methods: The effect of relacorilant on paclitaxel efficacy was assessed in OVCAR5 cells in vitro and in the MIA PaCa-2 xenograft. A phase 1 study of patients with advanced solid tumors was conducted to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel. Result(s): In OVCAR5 cells, relacorilant reversed the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids on paclitaxel efficacy (P < 0.001). Compared with paclitaxel alone, relacorilant + paclitaxel reduced tumor growth and slowed time to progression in xenograft models (both P < 0.0001). In the heavily pretreated phase 1 population [median (range) of prior regimens: 3 (1-8), prior taxane in 75.3% (55/73)], 33% (19/57) of response-evaluable patients achieved durable disease control (>=16 weeks) with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel and 28.6% (12/42) experienced longer duration of benefit than on prior taxane (up to 6.4x). The most common dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was neutropenia, which was manageable with prophylactic G-CSF. Clinical benefit with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel was also associated with GR-regulated transcript-level changes in a panel of GR-controlled genes. Conclusion(s): The observed preclinical, clinical, and GRspecific pharmacodynamic responses demonstrate that selective GR modulation with relacorilant combined with nab-paclitaxel may promote chemotherapy response and is tolerable. Further evaluation of this combination in tumor types responsive to taxanes is ongoing.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  -  Chemoresistance is often a cause of the failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Sorcin (SRI) is a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein involved in chemoresistant processes and is overexpressed in many chemoresistant cancer cells, including paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant ovarian cancer. Increased SRI can reduce the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol and mitochondria and the decrease of calcium ion concentration prevents the occurrence of apoptosis. Here we examined the SRI expression in multiple cancers using a human TissueArray and found that SRI expression was significantly higher in malignant tumor tissues. Furthermore, SRI was overexpressed, while intracellular calcium concentration was decreased, in chemoresistant cancer cells. To restore intracellular calcium homeostasis and overcome chemoresistance, we developed lipid-coated albumin-PTX nanoparticles loaded with SRI-siRNA (LANP-PTX-siSRI) for PTX and SRI-siRNA co-delivery. LANP-PTX-siSRI had dual-target roles in the regulation of SRI and the delivery of PTX into chemoresistant cells. The LANP-PTX-siSRI inhibited the expression of SRI and enhanced intracellular calcium, leading to the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of the growth of PTX-resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the mechanism study revealed that the overexpression of SRI was associated with an impaired TGF-beta signaling pathway. The administration of TGF-beta1 inhibited two calcium-binding proteins SRI and S100A14. In conclusion, our data unveil that restoring intracellular calcium ion homeostasis via reducing SRI expression can reverse chemoresistance. Thus, the fabricated LANP-PTX-siSRI has a potentially therapeutical application.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  -  More than 90% of ovarian cancer deaths are due to relapse following development of chemoresistance. Our main objective is to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying paclitaxel resistance (taxol resistance, Txr) in ovarian cancer. Here, we observed that the linker histone H1.0 is upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of H1.0 significantly downregulates the androgen receptor (AR) and sensitizes paclitaxel-resistant SKOV3/Txr and 2774/Txr cell lines to paclitaxel. Conversely, ectopic expression of H1.0 upregulates AR and increases Txr in parental SKOV3 and MDAH2774 cells. Notably, H1.0 upregulation is associated with disease recurrence and poor survival in a subset of ovarian cancer subjects. Inhibition of PI3K significantly reduces H1.0 mRNA and protein levels in paclitaxel-resistant cells, suggesting the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of H1.0 and AR also downregulates the Txr genes ABCB1 and ABCG2 in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Our data show that H1.0 induces GCN5 expression and histone acetylation, thereby enhancing Txr gene transactivation. These findings suggest that Txr in ovarian cancer involves the PI3K/AKT pathway and leads to upregulation of histone H1.0, recruitment of GCN5 and AR, followed by upregulation of a subgroup of Txr genes that include ABCB1 and ABCG2. This study is the first report describing the relationship between histone H1.0 and GCN5 that cooperate to induce AR-dependent Txr in ovarian cancer cells.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is the eminent gynecological malignancy and chemoresistance remains a major reason for poor in ovarian cancer patients. Taxol has been proved as the most effective chemotherapeutic agent against ovarian cancer. However development of Taxol resistance remains a major problem. Here, we report that STAT3, directly activates pentose-phosphate pathway to exert pro-oncogenic effects on Taxol resistance of ovarian cancer. In addition, we found that STAT3, p-STAT3 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) protein levels are upregulated in Taxol resistant cell lines compared with Taxol sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 decreased G6PD mRNA expression level and enhanced the sensitivity of Taxol resistant cell to Taxol. Finally, we found that STAT3 directly binds to the G6PD promoter region and promotes the expression of G6PD at transcriptional level. Taken together, our data indicate that activation of STAT3 promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and Taxol resistance via augmenting G6PD expression and pentose-phosphate metabolism flux, which provides a potential therapeutic target that may improve prognosis by decreasing G6PD expression and enhancing Taxol-sensitivity.Copyright © 2022

N2  -  Objective: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (Nab-TC) with that of traditional solvent-based paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (TC) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) regimens for primary epithelial ovarian cancer. Method(s): Eighty patients with advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer admitted for treatment at the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2015 to January 2020 were retrospectively selected. All patients underwent surgery after 1-4 courses of NAC with Nab-TC or TC regimen. Among the patients included for study, 40 patients in each group. Result(s): The ORR in Nab-TC group was better compared to TC group (45% vs 40%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.651). While the reduction rate of CA-125 value in the Nab-TC group was significantly better (P < 0.05). The postoperative complication rate such as postoperative blood transfusion (5% vs 35%) and postoperative infusion of human albumin (25% vs 55%) were significantly lower relative to the TC group. The median progression-free survival of the Nab-TC group was significantly longer relative to the TC group (20 months vs 13 months, P = 0.012), and the patient's quality of life was also better in the Nab-TC group (P < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that Nab-TC regimen and R0 represented the independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): The efficacy of the Nab-TC regimen as NAC for advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer was non-inferior to that of the TC regimen along with a lower incidence of adverse reactions, a longer PFS and a higher quality of life, supporting its therapeutic value in the clinic.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  -  TumorSelect is an anticancer technology that combines cytotoxics, nanotechnology, and knowledge of human physiology to develop innovative therapeutic interventions with minimal undesirable side effects commonly observed in conventional chemotherapy. Tumors have a voracious appetite for cholesterol which facilitates tumor growth and fuels their proliferation. We have transformed this need into a stealth delivery system to disguise and deliver anticancer drugs with the assistance of both the human body and the tumor cell. Several designer prodrugs are incorporated within pseudo-LDL nanoparticles, which carry them to tumor tissues, are taken up, internalized, transformed into active drugs, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Highly lipophilic prodrug conjugates of paclitaxel suitable for incorporation into the pseudo-LDL nanoparticles of the TumorSelect delivery vehicle formulation were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in the panel of 24-h NCI-60 human tumor cell line screening to demonstrate the power of such an innovative approach. Taxane prodrugs, viz., ART-207 was synthesized by tethering paclitaxel to lipid moiety with the aid of a racemic solketal as a linker in cost-effective, simple, and straightforward synthetic transformations. In addition to the typical 24-h NCI screening protocol, these compounds were assessed for growth inhibition or killing of ovarian cell lines for 48 and 72h-time intervals and identified the long-lasting effectiveness of these lipophilic prodrugs. All possible, enantiomerically pure isomers of ART-207 were also synthesized, and cytotoxicities were biosimilar to racemic ART-207, suggesting that enantiopurity of linker has a negligible effect on cell proliferation. To substantiate further, ART-207 was evaluated for its in vivo tumor reduction efficacy by studying the xenograft model of ovarian cancer grown in SCID mice. Reduced weight loss (a measure of toxicity) in the ART-207 group was observed, even though it was dosed at 2.5x the paclitaxel equivalent of Abraxane. As a result, our delineated approach is anticipated to improve patient quality of life, patient retention in treatment regimes, post-treatment rapid recovery, and overall patient compliance without compromising the efficacy of the cytotoxic promiscuous natural products.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  -  Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) play an important role in the treatment of advanced sarcomas. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a new kind of taxane and has many advantages compared with paclitaxel and docetaxel. Nab-paclitaxel is currently approved for the treatment of advanced breast, non-small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers. However, the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in sarcomas has not been reviewed. In this review, we first compare the similarities and differences among nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, and docetaxel and then summarize the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel against various non-sarcoma malignancies based on clinical trials with reported results. The efficacy and clinical research progress on nab-paclitaxel in sarcomas are also summarized. This review will serve as a good reference for the application of nab-paclitaxel in clinical sarcoma treatment studies and the design of clinical trials.Copyright © 2022 Tian and Yao.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate ophthalmic side effects of taxanes and compare side effect frequency, requirement for cessation of taxane therapy, visual acuity outcome, and concurrent systemic effects between paclitaxel and docetaxel. Method(s): Patients taking taxanes at a single center from 1/1/2010 to 2/29/2020 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatments, and concurrent systemic adverse effects. Result(s): Of 1918 patients, 22 (1.1%) experienced an ophthalmic side effect that came to the attention of an eye care provider. Mean age at presentation of the side effect was 62 years (median 66, range 23-82). The most common side effect was meibomian gland dysfunction in 5 (23%) patients, followed by cystoid macular edema in 4 (18%) patients and canalicular obstruction in 4 (18%) patients, followed by diplopia in 2 (9%) patients, and singular cases of lash alopecia, and blepharitis, among others. Lids/lashes as well as nasolacrimal duct adverse effects occurred more frequently with docetaxel therapy than with paclitaxel therapy. Follow-up was available in 10 (45%) patients, with mean duration of 5 months (median 4, range 0-12 months). Of these patients, the ophthalmic side effects were resolved or controlled without discontinuing therapy in 8 (80%) patients. Taxane cessation was required in one patient with docetaxel-related canalicular obstruction and one patient with paclitaxel-related cystoid macular edema. Conclusion(s): Ophthalmic taxane-related adverse events are rare with estimated frequency of ophthalmic side effects of about 1%. Nevertheless, it is important that ophthalmologists recognize the range of side effects for optimal management. Most ophthalmic events can be treated with targeted therapy without discontinuation of life-prolonging taxane therapy.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

N2  -  Though the great success of paclitaxel, the variable response of patients to the drug limits its clinical utility and the precise mechanisms underlying the variable response to paclitaxel remain largely unknown. This study aims to verify the role and the underlying mechanisms of CD147 in paclitaxel resistance. Immunostaining was used to analyze human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer tissues. RNA-sequencing was used to identify downstream effectors. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed to determine protein interactions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed to measure the speed of microtubule turnover. Xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate sensitivity of cancer cells to paclitaxel in vivo. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that silencing CD147 sensitized the cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. CD147 protected cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis regardless of p53 status. Truncation analysis showed that the intracellular domain of CD147 (CD147ICD) was indispensable for CD147-regulated sensitivity to paclitaxel. Via screening the interacting proteins of CD147ICD, Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) was identified to interact with CD147ICD via its C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that RanBP1 mediated CD147-regulated microtubule stability and dynamics as well as response to paclitaxel treatment. These results demonstrated that CD147 regulated paclitaxel response by interacting with the C-terminal tail of RanBP1 and targeting CD147 may be a promising strategy for preventing paclitaxel resistant.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  -  Background: Therapy options for patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer are limited. Cortisol contributes to chemotherapy resistance, one driver of poor outcomes, by suppressing apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. A phase 2 study of relacorilant (RELA) + nab-paclitaxel (NP) in patients with ovarian cancer has shown that glucocorticoid receptor modulation with RELA can improve the efficacy of NP. In all patients, intermittent RELA + NP significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) and improved overall survival (OS) without additional side-effect burden. We present results in the subgroup mirroring the patient population of an upcoming phase 3 study. Method(s): 178 women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with <=4 prior lines of chemotherapy were enrolled in a phase 2, open-label, randomized study of 2 RELA dosing schedules + NP vs NP alone (NCT03776812). The subgroup of patients without primary platinum-refractory disease and with 1-3 prior lines of therapy ("phase 3 population") comprised 137 patients, of whom 46 received NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) and 50 received NP alone (100 mg/m2). NP was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Result(s): In this subgroup, intermittent RELA + NP resulted in improvements vs NP alone in PFS (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91, log-rank P=0.0162; median PFS 5.6 vs 3.8 mo); duration of response (DoR; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.62, log-rank P=0.0009; median DoR 5.6 vs 3.6 mo); and OS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.86, log-rank P=0.0097; median OS 13.9 vs 12.2 mo). Objective response rates were similar and numerically favored RELA + NP (41.9% vs 38.6%). Conclusion(s): In addition to the improvements seen in all patients, intermittent RELA + NP improved PFS, OS, and DoR in the "phase 3 population" subgroup. This confirms the potential of intermittent RELA + NP in this patient population, which will be studied further in an upcoming phase 3 trial (ROSELLA, NCT05257408).

N2  -  Background: Cortisol activity at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) contributes to chemotherapy resistance by suppressing apoptotic pathways that taxanes utilize, and high tumor GR expression is associated with poor chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer. A phase 2 ovarian cancer study (NCT03776812) demonstrated the clinical benefit of adding relacorilant (RELA), a selective GR modulator, to nab-paclitaxel (NP) compared to NP alone. We present biomarker analyses from this study. Method(s): A phase 2, open-label, randomized study of RELA in combination with NP compared with NP alone was conducted in patients with ovarian cancer. 127 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples collected as part of the study were analyzed using a CLIA-validated GR immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RNA expression was measured in whole blood using a custom NanoStringTM panel focused on GR target genes. Result(s): Tumor GR expression (IHC H-score >0) was observed in 96% (122/127) of tumor samples. High tumor GR expression (H-score >=100) was observed in 65% (82/127) of samples and associated with non-response to NP-only (stable or progressive disease). In contrast, high GR expression was associated with good response (partial or complete response) in patients receiving RELA + NP (chi2P= 0.037). Subjects with low baseline plasma TGF-beta1 (<30,000 pg/mL) treated with RELA + NP had significantly longer overall survival (OS) compared to those with high TGF-beta1 (P<0.0001). Of 239 genes previously shown to be GR target genes, 221 were suppressed after RELA + NP treatment. Significantly fewer GR target genes were suppressed by NP (P<0.00001). GR target genes that were suppressed by RELA + NP but not NP alone included SGK1 (P=0.013), PIK3CG (P=0.018), and GSK3B (P=0.05). Conclusion(s): GR expression was abundant in the ovarian tumors assessed in this study. High GR expression was associated with poor outcomes in patients treated with NP alone. In contrast, high baseline tumor GR expression was associated with good response in patients treated with RELA + NP. Low plasma TGF-beta1 predicted longer OS. Suppression of GR-target genes indicated systemic GR antagonism by RELA. Clinical trial identification: NCT03776812.

N2  -  Objectives: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an increasingly common primary treatment in advanced ovarian cancer. This study assessed real-world treatment patterns in advanced ovarian cancer using an electronic health record (EHR)-derived national database evaluated differences in treatment modality according to demographic characteristics, described specific chemotherapeutic agents and regimens used in NACT, and examined differences in treatment duration and time to next treatment. Method(s): This retrospective study of patients diagnosed with tubal, peritoneal, or ovarian cancer between January 1, 2011, and March 31, 2020, was conducted using the US nationwide Flatiron Health EHR- derived de-identified database. Patients were included if they had a confirmed new diagnosis of advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer and received chemotherapy or surgery as their initial treatment within 90 days of diagnosis. Patients' demographics were described and compared by treatment groups using ANOVA or Chi-square tests. Rates of initial treatment with surgery or chemotherapy were calculated. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was calculated from the start of initial treatment to the start of second-line therapy or death and censored at the date of the last confirmed visit. TTNT was estimated using Kaplan Meier curves with a 3-month landmark. Result(s): Our final cohort included 2917 patients. Sixteen percent of the total cohort (481 patients) received chemotherapy only without surgical intervention, and 10% (291 patients) received only surgery. The overall mean age was 65 years, with NACT patients being slightly older (67.5 vs 63.6 years, p<0.001). Although Black and Hispanic patients had equal proportions undergoing NACT versus primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS), a greater proportion of White (55% vs 44%) and Asian (69 vs 30%) patients received PCS. More NACT patients had an ECOG score of 2/3/4 (59% vs 40%, p<0.001), and more patients receiving PCS were treated at an academic center (62% vs 37%, p=0.08). NACT use as primary treatment increased from 26% in the first quarter of 2011 to 61% in the first quarter of 2020. Among the 1323 patients who received chemotherapy first, the most common regimen was carboplatin and paclitaxel (74%), followed by carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (14%). The remaining 12% of patients received non-standard chemotherapy regimens, including docetaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, pemetrexed, cisplatin, abraxane, or a poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. The unadjusted median time to the next treatment was longer for PCS compared to NACT patients (13.8 vs 10.3 months). Conclusion(s): In this real-world population, NACT is becoming increasingly common, with the majority of advanced-stage patients receiving NACT. Time to next treatment was longer for patients receiving PCS, and NACT regimens are heterogeneous in chemotherapeutic agents used. These results provide insight into the shifting treatment patterns for patients over the last decade, which likely impacts patient counseling and healthcare utilization.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background: Chemotherapy resistance is a major concern in the treatment of advanced platinum-resistant and platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. One mechanism of resistance is driven by cortisol, which can suppress the apoptotic pathways that chemotherapy agents rely upon, eg, suppression of BCL2 and FOXO3a pathways. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism may reverse the anti-apoptotic effects of cortisol, thereby restoring the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. Relacorilant is a selective GR modulator that has shown promise in overcoming resistance when combined with taxanes (particularly nab-paclitaxel) in preclinical models (Greenstein & Hunt 2021) and early-phase clinical studies (Munster et al. 2019) in various solid tumors. A randomized, controlled phase 2 study of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel found clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) without increased side effect burden in patients with recurrent, platinum-refractory and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (Colombo et al. 2021). The aim of this phase 3 study is to confirm these phase 2 findings in a larger patient population. Method(s): ROSELLA (EudraCT 2022-000662-18, NCT pending) is a phase 3, randomized, 2- arm, open-label, multicenter study of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel compared to investigator's choice of chemotherapy agents in patients with confirmed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The trial is being conducted at multiple sites in North America and Europe and has a planned enrollment of 360 patients. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either relacorilant (150 mg the day before, day of, and day after nab-paclitaxel infusion) + nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, topotecan, or nab-paclitaxel). Randomization is stratified by prior lines of therapy (1 vs > 1), region of world (North America vs Europe), and prior bevacizumab (yes/no). Adult female patients with platinum-resistant disease (progression within 6 months of completion of platinum-containing therapy), excluding patients with primary platinum refractory disease, who have received 1-3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy and at least 1 prior line of platinum therapy are being enrolled. Life expectancy >=3 months, adequate organ function, and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 are required. The primary study endpoint is PFS by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator, overall response rate, best overall response, DOR, clinical benefit rate, safety, quality of life, CA-125, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) is the the leading cause of cancer death in females. Most cases present at advanced stage. Standard treatment is cytoreductive surgery before or after paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy (CT) followed by maintenance treatment. Weekly CT is at least as effective as three weekly CT in OC, and may overcome resistance in some patients. Hyperthermia has been used alone or in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced cancer. Radiofrequency hyperthermia (Oncothermia-OT) is theoretically more effective and comfortable form of hyperthermia due to its selective effects on tumor cells. Since most advanced patients have disease limited to the abdominal cavity, OT can be applied with a single electrode to cover the whole abdomen. Immediately following CT, OT may result in aggregation of DNA repair ezymes secreted in response to CT in cancer cells. Method(s): We used weekly CT with paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel with carboplatin followed immediately by OT. (Oncotherm-EHY 3010) to the whole abdomen for one hour for eighteen weeks in 22 consecutive patients with advanced (III or IV) ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer between 2016 and 2021. 19 patients received bevacizumab every three weeks in addition to chemotherapy.All pts had ECOG PS 0-1. Maintenance treatment was bevacizumab (19 patients) or olaparib (3 patients) for one year. Patients were followed by periodic CT/MRI/PET-CT and CA-125 levels. Result(s): All patients completed eighteen weeks of planned treatment. No unexpected or grade III-IV toxicity was observed. Complete response was obtained in 21 patients and partial response in one patient. Median follow up is 30 months (range 8-73 months).18 patients are alive, with 12 patients in ongoing remission and 6 patients receiving palliative treatment. 4 patients have died of cancer. Conclusion(s): Although this is a single center retrospective observation, the combination of weekly paclitaxel/nabpaclitaxel and carboplatin CT in combination with immediate weekly OT appears tolerable and feasible. Despite all of the limitations of this observation, activity of CT and OT appears promising. These findings should be confirmed with prospective randomized trials.

N2  -  Background: Cortisol contributes to chemotherapy resistance by suppressing apoptotic pathways that cytotoxic agents utilize. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulation with relacorilant (RELA) reverses the anti-apoptotic effects of cortisol and restores the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. We report overall survival (OS) results from a randomized, controlled phase 2 study of RELA + nab-paclitaxel (NP) compared to NP only in patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03776812). The primary analysis showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) and a favorable safety profile with intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only, despite overrepresentation of primary platinum-refractory patients in the intermittent RELA + NP (n = 7) vs the NP-only arm (n = 1). Method(s): A phase 2, open-label, randomized, 3-arm study of 2 RELA dosing schedules + NP compared with NP only was performed. 178 women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with <=4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to: a) NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) (n = 60); b) NP (80 mg/m2) + continuous RELA (100 mg QD) (n = 58); or c) NP only (100 mg/m2) (n = 60). NP was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS; OS was a secondary endpoint. OS data for the intermittent and continuous arms were compared to NP only using a 2-sided log-rank test, stratified by presence of ascites and relapse within 6 months on previous taxane, at a 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment. Result(s): At the pre-defined OS analysis (128 OS events), hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.67 (95% CI [0.43, 1.03], P= 0.066) and 0.85 (95% CI [0.56, 1.29], P= 0.447) for intermittent and continuous RELA + NP vs NP only. Median OS was 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]), 11.3 (95% CI [7.5, 16.4]), and 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months in the intermittent RELA + NP, continuous RELA + NP, and NP-only arms. In the subgroup of patients without primary platinum-refractory disease, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed with HR 0.63 (95% CI [0.39, 0.99], P= 0.045) and median OS of 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]) vs 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months for intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only. Conclusion(s): In addition to the improved PFS and DOR observed at the primary analysis, the OS analysis confirmed the survival benefit of intermittent RELA + NP compared to NP only, particularly in patients who were not primary platinum refractory. A phase 3 trial evaluating intermittent RELA + NP vs investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients without primary platinum-refractory disease is ongoing (NCT05257408).

N2  -  Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world, and one of the most difficult to treat. In 2020, an estimated 495,000 individuals worldwide were diagnosed. According to Croatian Institute for public health 743 patients were diagnosed in Croatia in 2019. Most patients with advanced disease die within a year of treatment, and most with localized early-stage disease do not survive beyond five years. Pancreatic cancer incidence has doubled in the past 25 years, due in part to global population aging and the increasing percentage of people who have diabetes or are obese. These three factors all increase risk of developing pancreatic cancer, and help explain locations of highest risk and disease incidence. Additional risk factors include consistent heavy alcohol consumption, and familial history. Some of the mutations have been identified that contribute to genetic risk, and which can help determine the most effective treatment. Most common are pathogenic variants in BRCA2, associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and the ATM gene which are associated with about a 406-fold increased risk. Mutations in the mismatch repair gene most associated with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer have about an eight-fold risk, as well as mutations in genes most notably associated with hereditary pancreatitis. If it is available, germline genetic testing for all pancreatic cancer patients, regardless of family history should be considered. Clinical challenges of pancreatic cancer include late/advanced presentation (vague symptoms, limitations if current imaging modalities, no adequate screening modality); rapid tumor growth and metastasis; high recurrence rate following surgery; relative resistance to conventional therapy and few predictive biomarkers to guide treatment. Fewer than 20% of newly diagnosed patients are candidates for surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy recommendation depends of pathohystologic findings. Combination of gemcitabine/capecitabine or m FOLFIRINOX are preferred regimens. In 30%-40% of patients, while the tumour is confined to the pancreatic region, resection is not feasible, mainly due to vascular invasion. This subgroup of patients might be assigned into two different categories: borderline resectable and locally advanced disease. Borderline resectable disease should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Options include the following FOLFIRINOX/modified FOLFIRINOX, with or without subsequent chemoradiation; gemcitabine+ albumin-bound paclitaxel, with or without subsequent chemoradiation; gemcitabine + cisplatin (>=2-6 cycles) followed by chemoradiation (only for known BRCA1/2 mutations). In patients with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment in combination of local ablation whenever is possible. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and microwave ablation appear to be feasible. Several of these ablative techniques have been shown to provide pain relief and improved survival. Metastatic disease treatment depends upon disease burden and especially performance status. For patients with good performance status FOLFIRINOX and mFOLFIRINOX as well as nab-paklitaxel/gemcitabine combination is preferred, and for those with poor performance status gemcitabine monotherapy should be offered. Patients with germline BRCA mutations cisplatin/gemcitabine protocol might be an option. Olaparib is approved for maintenance treatment of adults with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutated metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Second and other treatment lines depends on patient performance status, previous treatment, drug availability and patient preferences. New drug formulations such as encapsulated form of irinotecan, according to NAPOLI I trial shown benefit in terms of progression free survival and overall survival for patients previously treated with gemcitabine based chemotherapy. Personalized and precision medical treatments have not been as effective for pancreatic cancers as they have with other types of cancer. Some precision medicine treatment options have been developed that are showing partial and complete responses. But they tend to be for rare mutations, such as germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (5%-7% of patients), K-ras mutations (less than 1%), and MMR deficiencies (less than 5%). New chemotherapy drugs being developed, such as those targeting the stroma. Immunotherapy and predicts that it will be used in conjunction with chemotherapy in the future. Palliative therapy should be administered early in the course of the disease ie. for the pain relief, obstructive jaundice and duodenal obstruction secondary to tumor infiltration.

N2  -  To observe the clinical efficacy of bevacizumab combined with albumin-conjugated paclitaxel in the treatment of platinum-resistant, relapsed and metastatic ovarian cancer, 70 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer were divided into observation group and control group by random number table. The control group received only albumin-binding paclitaxel monotherapy (d 1, d 8, d 15). The observation group was treated with bevacizumab based on the treatment of the control group. The clinical efficacy, adverse reactions and quality of life of patients, immune function of two groups were observed and compared.6 cycles of chemotherapy were successfully completed in both groups. The ORR of the observation group was 57.1% (20/35), which was not significantly different from that of the control group (48.6%, 17/35) (chi2=0.516, P>0.05).The total clinical benefit rate of the observation group was 94.3% (33/35), which was significantly higher than that of the control group (77.1%, 27/35) (chi2=4.200, P<0.05).The median PFS was 8.9 months for the observation group and 16.2 months for the median OS.The median PFS was 6.8 months for the control group and 14.8 months for the median OS. The median PFS and median OS in the observation group were significantly longer than in the control group (chi2=12.563, 10.628, P<0.01).The improvement rate of quality of life in the observation group was 77.1%(27/35), which was significantly higher than that of the control group (45.7%, 16/35) (chi2=7.295, P<0.01).There were no significant differences in immune function and adverse reactions between the observation group and the control group (P>0.05). Bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel in combination with paclitaxel has better clinical effect in the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with recurrence and metastasis. It is better than single-agent chemotherapy in survival of patients and better tolerability, and has good clinical application.Copyright © 2021, Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology.

N2  -  Aims: Due to poor targeting ability of anti-tumor drugs and self-adaptation of tumors, the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer is still poorly effective. In recent years, the treatment of tumor with nano-targeted agents has become a potential research focus. In this study, a new type of short cell-penetrating peptide RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes were constructed to disrupt VM channels, angiogenesis, proliferation and migration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, clone assay, TUNEL, Transwell, wound-healing, CAM and mimics assay were used to detect the effects of RPV-modified liposomes on ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells before and after treatment. HE-staining, immunofluorescence and ELISA were used to further detect the expression of tumor-related proteins. Key Findings: RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes can inhibit angiogenesis, VM channel formation, invasion and proliferation of ovarian SK-OV-3 cells. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that tumor-related protein expression was down-regulated. Modification of RPV can prolong the retention time of liposome in vivo and accumulate in the tumor site, increasing the anti-tumor efficacy. Significance: The RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes have good anti-tumor effect, thus may provide a new avenue for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2021

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) is a natural anti-cancer drug - a terpene alkaloid from the taxane group, used in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian and breast cancer as well Kaposi's sarcoma. PTX shows a very good therapeutic effect when is used in monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer drugs. For the first time, it was isolated from the Pacific yew bark (Taxus brevifolia) and introduced into treatment under the name "Taxol" by the American biopharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb. The basic mechanism of its action consists in blocking the cell cycle during the G2/M phase by blocking depolymerization of microtubules, which inhibits mitosis. Moreover, PTX can cause cell necrosis through multipolar divisions and incorrect chromosome segregation.Copyright © 2021 Medical University of Warsaw. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective antineoplastic drugs employed for breast and ovarian cancer therapy. However, the neurotoxicity associated with PTX administration represents one of its main drawbacks reducing patient life quality. Recently, curcumin (CUR) has been explored as a neuroprotective agent due to its antioxidant properties. Then, the co-encapsulation of PTX and CUR in a mixed micellar formulation could promote a neuroprotective effect of the micellar system and optimize breast and ovarian cancer therapy. PTX-CUR-loaded Soluplus:TPGS mixed micelles were developed and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, scattering techniques and transmission electron microscopy. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated in MDA-MB-231 and SKOV-3 cancer cells. The in vitro antioxidant performance of CUR-loaded nanoformulations was confirmed employing lipid peroxidation inhibition and DPPH colorimetric assays. The neuroprotective effect of the micellar formulations was evaluated on zebrafish larvae. Mixed micelles demonstrated an excellent colloidal stability, before and after freeze-drying. Nanoformulations with both drugs demonstrated the best in vitro anticancer performance versus the commercially available nanoformulation Abraxane in breast and ovarian cancer cells lines. The in vitro antioxidant properties of the mixed micelles with CUR were confirmed and their in vivo potential neuroprotective effect was assessed in the zebrafish model.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Cancer is the second well-known cause of death. Approx 18.1 million cancer cases have been recorded worldwide (9.5 million men and 8.5 million women) in 2018. In the case of women, 25.4% of cases were of breast cancer, 6.9% of cervical cancer, and it is the fourth most common cancer in women. About 3.6% of ovarian cancer from the total number of new cases diagnosed in 2018. With this expanding global burden, prevention of cancer in women is one of the most serious public health challenges of the 21st century. Nanotechnology offers advantageous drug delivery systems that support its ability to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Nanoformulation is frequently employed precisely to aim the target organ, to maintain the bioactivity of drug load, preferentially accumulate the drug at the target site as well as reducing the cytotoxicity. There are various nanoformulation based chemotherapeutic delivery systems have been used by the US-FDA for clinical trials for treatment of breast, cervical and ovarian cancer. These delivery systems include lipid-based nanoformulation, vesicular nanosystem, polymeric nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticle, carbon nanotubes, and theranaustic formulation. Doxil and Abraxane are the first anticancer nanoformulation available in the market. The aim of this review summarized potential research on nanoformulation used in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  AIMS: Due to poor targeting ability of anti-tumor drugs and self-adaptation of tumors, the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer is still poorly effective. In recent years, the treatment of tumor with nano-targeted agents has become a potential research focus. In this study, a new type of short cell-penetrating peptide RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes were constructed to disrupt VM channels, angiogenesis, proliferation and migration for the treatment of ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, clone assay, TUNEL, Transwell, wound-healing, CAM and mimics assay were used to detect the effects of RPV-modified liposomes on ovarian cancer SK-OV-3 cells before and after treatment. HE-staining, immunofluorescence and ELISA were used to further detect the expression of tumor-related proteins. KEY FINDINGS: RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes can inhibit angiogenesis, VM channel formation, invasion and proliferation of ovarian SK-OV-3 cells. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that tumor-related protein expression was down-regulated. Modification of RPV can prolong the retention time of liposome in vivo and accumulate in the tumor site, increasing the anti-tumor efficacy. SIGNIFICANCE: The RPV-modified paclitaxel plus schisandrin B liposomes have good anti-tumor effect, thus may provide a new avenue for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2021.

N2  -  Cancer is the second largest cause of death worldwide with the number of new cancer cases predicted to grow significantly in the next decades. Cytotoxic drugs are the main therapy against cancer; however, they are frequently associated with severe side-effects related to systemic toxicity and lack of tumor specificity. As consequence, the use of proteins as drug carriers has had great impact in the development of new approaches as drug delivery system (DDS) nanoparticles (NPs). For example, Abraxane, the first FDA-approved DDS NPs, is composed of serum albumin protein and paclitaxel drug, and has demonstrated higher tumor accumulation, patient toleration, and response rate than the free paclitaxel. Due to this, the aim of this research project is the development of a synergistic DDS NPs using serum albumin (BSA), as the drug's carrier, coupling two cytotoxic drugs: doxorubicin (DOX), and the natural triterpene betulinic acid (BeA). This system BSA[(Dox)(BeA)] was done by using water in oil (W/O)-like emulsion followed by heat and ultrasonication. To characterize the BSA and Dox concentration in the DDS, colorimetric assays were performed. DDS's size was determined ~ 100 nm using dynamic light scattering. All the developed DDS demonstrated a strong IC50 in the muM range after 24h incubated with lung (A549) and resistant-ovarian (A2780-CP20) cancer cells. A complete discussion of the results will be presented. These DDS have potential to minimize drug systemic toxicity and increase drug bioavailability. Schematic representation to develop protein-based DDS NPs where serum albumin (BSA) incorporates two cytotoxic drugs: doxorubicin (DOX) and betulinic acid (BeA) using water in oil (W/O)-like emulsion method followed by by heat and ultrasonication.

N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is resistant to PD1/PDL1 blocking antibodies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if immunotherapy with LOAd703, an oncolytic adenovirus armed with trimerized CD40L and 4-1BBL, can sensitize PDAC to mAbs targeting PD1/PDL1. The high content of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDCSs) in the tumor microenvironment may in part explain the limited anti-tumor T cell response in PDAC. We have previously shown that gemcitabine can reduce MDSCs in patients with PDAC, with the T cell proliferative capacity remaining intact. Further, LOAd703 has been demonstrated to efficiently and robustly kill PDAC cells and stimulate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which, in turn, induces T cell activation. Patients with advanced PDAC, colorectal, biliary, and ovarian cancer (NCT03225989) were treated with intratumoral injections of LOAd703 combined with appropriate chemotherapy such as gemcitabine +/- nab-paclitaxel for PDAC patients, or combined with gemcitabine if there was no standard of care. Blood sampling was performed for immune cell profiling and antiadenovirus antibodies (flow cytometry, ELISA). Tumor biopsies were also analyzed for mRNA expression (NanoString; PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel). The study was approved by the ethical review board and the Swedish Medical Products Agency. The dose of LOAd703 was escalated (5 x 10e10 VP, 1 x 10e11 VP, 5 x 10e11VP) in separate cohorts of new patients and administered every other week. To date, blood samples from 23 patients have been analyzed by flow cytometry to profile immune cells. The mean percentages of monocytic-and granulocytic MDSCs, Tregs and M2-like myeloid cells were significantly decreased after treatment initiation. The effector memory (EM) and central memory (CM) CD8+ T cells were significantly increased, while naive and CM cells were increased among CD4 T cells. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing ICOS were present post-treatment but only CD8 T cells showed significant elevation of PD1. The NanoString data were analyzed using published mRNA immune signatures (bioinformatics). LOAd703 in combination with chemotherapy inflamed tumor lesions as shown by increased markers of the T cell inflamed signature (16 genes), T effector cell signature (19 genes), expanded immune signature (25 genes) and IFNg-related gene signature (12 genes) (week 1 versus week 13). Antiadenovirus antibody titers increased in all patients after treatment initiation. The antibody levels did not correlate with the dose of virus, radiological response to treatment, nor overall survival. The results presented herein show that LOAd703 combined with chemotherapy enhances immune reactivity in patients with immune cold tumors as demonstrated by increases in EM and CM T cells in the peripheral blood, while suppressive immune cells were decreased. Further, the tumor milieu was inflamed post treatment as shown by mRNA profiling. Hence, LOAd703 may sensitize immune cold tumors to mAbs targeting PD1/PDL1.

N2  -  Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with the majority of cases being discovered metastatic with spread to the lung, liver, spleen, bone, and other organs through the lymphoid system. Ovarian metastasis is rare. Here we present a case of a patient that presented with metastatic pancreatic cancer, and later being found to have bilateral ovarian involvement with ulceration into the recto-sigmoid junction. Case Description/Methods: A 66-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis presented with 60-pound weight loss and abdominal pain for a year. She underwent CT scan which showed distention of the duodenum to the distal transverse portion concerning for duodenal mass versus adjacent pancreatic neoplasm. PET scan was conducted and showed hypermetabolic activity in the region of the pancreatic uncinate process, hypermetabolic activity with multiple nodules throughout the peritoneal cavity, increased activity in the right adnexa, and focal activity in the liver. CT-guided biopsy of the peritoneal deposit revealed adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemical staining suggesting pancreaticobiliary origin. Patient was started on gemcitabine/abraxane every two weeks with marked clinical improvement. Months later, she began developing worsening pelvic pain. On surveillance CT, she was found to have bilateral adnexal densities measuring up to 4.5 cm on the left and 3.3 cm on the right, CA125 level was 104. Patient was sent for lower EUS and a single 1.2 cm ulcer was found in the recto-sigmoid junction with biopsy results showing metastatic adenocarcinoma. Patient was subsequently referred for palliative radiotherapy with clinical improvement. Discussion(s): Metastatic ovarian cancer due to gastrointestinal cancers are known as Kruckenberg tumors, but ovarian metastasis due to pancreatic cancer is a rare occurrence with one analysis reporting 35 cases. Much of the time, the patient will present with abdominal pain, and ovarian metastasis are found incidentally with no specific clinical symptoms. Our patient developed pelvic pain and had involvement of the colon, which has not been reported previously. CA125 elevation has been noted in previous cases, with one report mentioning 9/10 cases. Features suggesting ovarian metastasis is bilateral involvement, moderate tumor size (, 10 cm), and intra-abdominal spread. Palliative ovariectomy is recommended to relieve clinical symptoms, but our patient had developed recto-sigmoid invasion making surgical intervention difficult.

N2  -  Introduction: Infiltrating lobular carcinomas are the second most common type of invasive breast cancer after invasive ductal carcinoma. Lobular carcinomas metastasize in unpredictable invasion patterns and can present atypically, making early detection and successful management a challenging problem for clinicians. Despite the high incidence of invasive lobular breast carcinoma, few cases of metastasis to the right ascending colon have been reported in the literature. Case Description/Methods: A 58-year-old female presented with an abnormal sensation in her left breast. Lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection revealed oligometastatic estrogen receptor (1) lobular carcinoma. PET scan showed no distant metastasis, however, her decision to undergo prophylactic total abdominal hysterectomy & bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) led to detection of an incidental ovarian metastasis on histologic examination. The patient then underwent chest wall radiation with subsequent hormone-based chemotherapy (Anastrozole & Letrozole), successfully achieving a state of remission. Eight years later, a supraclavicular lymph node appeared with neck node biopsy revealing recurrent disease with loss of ER expression. Restaging CT scan revealed circumferential thickening in the ascending colon. Clinically, the patient only complained of intermittent abdominal cramps without melena or hematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed notable ascending colon wall thickening and luminal narrowing but without mucosal/intraluminal dysplastic/ neoplastic appearance. Biopsy of benign appearing colon polyps was notable for deposits of metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Given this isolated area of highly symptomatic disease, she underwent right hemicolectomy. A novel treatment paradigm with the immunotherapy Atezolizumab, combined with nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel, is planned as her next step in management. Discussion(s): Our case demonstrates how patients with colonic metastasis of lobular carcinoma may have a mild clinical presentation that undermines the true severity of the underlying disease. The bland appearance of the colon and vague thickening contrasted with the surprising finding of not only diffuse replacement of 44 out of 45 lymph nodes, but also quite extensive replacement of the colonic parenchyma with metastatic lobular breast carcinoma. Clinicians managing patients with lobular carcinoma should maintain a high level of suspicion when encountering mild abnormalities on imaging or patient reported gastrointestinal symptoms.

N2  -  Background We performed a phase I first-in-human trial of PIPAC using nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (Nab-PTX, Abraxane) in patients with upper gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer. Methods Eligible patients underwent three PIPAC treatments using Nab-PTX with a four-week interval. The dose of Nab-PTX was escalated from 35 to 140 mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Secondary endpoints included surgical morbidity, pharmacokinetics (PK), histological treatment response, and OS. Results Twenty-three patients were included; thirteen (65%) patients combined PIPAC therapy with systemic chemotherapy. The primary tumor was gastric (55%), ovarian (20%), hepatobiliary or pancreatic (15%), breast (5%), and miscellaneous (5%). No dose limiting toxicity was observed. Eight patients showed surgical site complications including infection and dehiscence (grade 1 to 3). Treatment was associated with histological response in 35% of patients, while stable disease and progressive disease were found in 35% and 30%, respectively. The absorption of PTX continued long after the end of the procedure (30 min), whith the Tmax reached between 2 and 6 h after initiation of the procedure. Tumor PTX concentrations suggested accumulation. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Visual Analog Score (VAS) scores remained stable. Conclusion PIPAC with Nab-PTX may be applied safely up to a dose of 140 mg/m2 and results in a favorable PK profile and promising anticancer activity.

N2  -  Background: Pre-clinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism may enhance/restore chemotherapy sensitivity. This is the first randomized, controlled study to explore the efficacy and safety of relacorilant (RELA), a selective GR modulator, in combination w/ nab-paclitaxel (nab-pac) compared to nab-pac alone. Method(s): Women w/ recurrent platinum-resistant/refractory high grade serous or endometroid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma w/ measurable or non-measurable disease and up to 4 chemotherapeutic regimens were 1:1:1 randomized to: -CONTINUOUS 100mg RELA daily (w/discretionary escalation to 150mg) + 80mg/m2 nab-pac on days 1, 8, and 15 of a q28-day schedule; or -INTERMITTENT 150mg RELA the day before, of, and after 80mg/m2 nab-pac on days 1, 8, and 15, of a q28-day schedule; or -COMPARATOR,100mg/m2 nab-pac on days 1, 8, and 15, of a q28-day schedule. A lower nab-pac dose was used with RELA because RELA inhibits the metabolism of nab-pac. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) determined by the investigator per RECIST 1.1. Result(s): 178 women were randomized. At median follow-up of 11.07 mos, the INTERMITTENT regimen significantly improved median PFS compared to nab-pac alone (HR, 0.66, 95%CI 0.44-0.98, log-rank test p=0.038). While ORR was similar, Duration of Response (DoR) was significantly improved (HR 0.36, 95% 0.16-0.77, p=0.006) in the INTERMITTENT regimen vs. nab-pac alone. Overall survival will be assessed at maturity. Most common grade >=3 adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. [Formula presented] Conclusion(s): INTERMITTENT RELA + nab-pac improved PFS and had a favorable safety profile in recurrent platinum-resistant and/or platinum-refractory ovarian cancer patients.

N2  -  Systemic treatment of cancer using long-circulating nanomedicines is promising due to their passive tumor targeting ability to achieve higher and more selective accumulation in tumors with irregular vascularization, a phenomenon known as extended permeation and retention (EPR) effect.1,2 Clinical use of nanometer-sized carriers, such as Doxil and Abraxane, to deliver chemotherapeutics to solid tumors is proven effective in highly vascularized tumors such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, and Kaposi's sarcoma.3-5 Most nanomedicines that are being developed or approved so far have a diameter of around 100-200 nm for prolonged retention in highly angiogenic and densely vascularized tumors,6 however, they suffer from limited accumulation and poor penetration to the inner core of avascular or hypovascular tumors (such as prostate and pancreatic cancer),7-9 therefore nanomedicines small than 100 nm are more preferred for improved tumor penetration.10,11 Here we present our strategy to form cyclodextrin-based sub-30-nm nanocarriers, which allows easy drug encapsulation, and successful delivery of therapeutics to human tumor xenografts with significantly reduced tumor growth rates and improved survival rates.

N2  -  Background: ORIC-101 is a potent and selective, orally bioavailable, small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of GR signaling leads to decreased responsiveness to chemotherapeutics (eg, taxanes) and antiandrogens across multiple tumor types. Mechanistically, ORIC-101 inhibits GR transcriptional activity and blocks the prosurvival signals mediated by the activated nuclear hormone receptor. Method(s): A 3+3 dose escalation design was used to assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and select the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ORIC101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel (nabpac; NCT03928314). ORIC-101 doses ranging from 80 to 240 mg once daily, given either intermittently or in a continuous dosing regimen, were evaluated in combination with weekly nab-pac at 75 or 100 mg/m2. Plasma PK and PD biomarkers were assessed on day 1 and after repeat dosing. PD modulation in bloodderived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was assessed by RT-qPCR for GR target genes. Antitumor activity was assessed by RECIST v1.1. Result(s): 21 patients with 10 different solid tumors, with and without a prior taxane, were treated in 5 cohorts. ORIC-101 exposure increased with dose, with no evidence for drug-drug interaction with nab-pac. In the initial cohort at 240 mg ORIC-101 and 100 mg/m2 nab-pac, 2 patients experienced dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of Grade 3 fatigue and Grade 4 neutropenia/thrombocytopenia, respectively. No further DLTs were observed in subsequent cohorts and the RP2D was established as 160 mg ORIC-101 dosed once daily continuously for 21 days with nab-pac 75 mg/m2 given on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, without requirement for prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The most common (> 15%), all grade treatmentrelated adverse events (AEs) were nausea (38%), diarrhea (33%), fatigue (29%), leukopenia (29%), neutropenia (29%), anemia (24%), and 19% of patients had increased liver function tests and alopecia. Biomarker data demonstrated ORIC101-induced reduction in GR target gene expression in PBMCs, indicating PD modulation at all dose levels of ORIC-101. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in 3 taxanerefractory patients with breast, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers. Conclusion(s): The combination of ORIC-101 and nab-paclitaxel demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile and does not require prophylactic G-CSF. PK and PD showed no evidence of drug-druginteraction and demonstrated GR target inhibition. Preliminary antitumor activity was observed in patients with solid tumors that previously progressed on a taxane-containing regimen. Dose expansion is ongoing at the RP2D in dedicated pancreatic, ovarian, triple negative breast cancers, and tissue-agnostic cohorts.

N2  -  Background: FID-007 (FID) consists of paclitaxel encapsulated in a polyethyloxazoline (PEOX) polymer excipient designed to enhance PK, biodistribution, and tolerability. In addition to allowing the drug to remain in solution until it can enter a cancer cell, the PEOX nanoparticle preferentially delivers paclitaxel to the tumor through the leaky hyperpermeable vasculature. In xenograft studies, FID reduced or limited tumor growth in multiple tumor types including lung, gastric, breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer. FID was more effective at lower or comparable taxane doses with fewer side effects. We present the first-in-human trial of FID. Method(s): The study is evaluating the safety, PK, and efficacy of FID in pts with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective is to determine the MTD and RP2D. Pts received FID in doses between 15mg/m2 and 125mg/m2 using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. FID was given IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Eligibility included ECOG 0-2, adequate organ function, and no more than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic therapy for advanced disease. Result(s): Twenty-five pts were treated across 6 dose levels. Median age was 62 (44-76). ECOG PS was 2 in 1 pt and 1 in 64%. Median number of cycles was 2 (1-16). There were 2 DLTs of grade 3 rash at 100 mg/m2 . Given the transient nature of the rash and response to topical therapy, DLT definition was modified to exclude grade 3 rash that lasts <= 7 days and additional patients were treated at 100 mg/m2 which was deemed tolerable. There was 1 DLT of grade 3 neutropenia at 125 mg/m2 . All grade treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) in >= 25% of pts were rash (64%), alopecia (52%), pruritus (44%), anemia (44%) leukopenia, fatigue (40% each), dysgeusia, anorexia, nausea (32% each), and neutropenia (28%). Grade 3/4 TRAEs occurring in > 1 pt were anemia (20%), neutropenia, leukopenia, and maculopapular rash (16%). There were no treatment discontinuations due to toxicity. Twenty-two pts were evaluable for response by RECIST 1.1 with a PR rate of 14% (PR in pancreatic, biliary tract and NSCLC) and disease control rate of 59%. PK is linear and dose proportional. There is no paclitaxel accumulation after weekly dosing, and the t is between 18-26 hours. Conclusion(s): FID has a manageable safety profile with MTD not reached. Accrual is continuing at 125 mg/m2 . PK is linear, dose proportional and comparable to that of nab-paclitaxel. There is preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated pts across different tumor types. Enrollment in dose escalation continues. Combination studies with immunotherapeutic agents are planned.

N2  -  Background: Nanoparticles hold considerable promise for aerosol-based IP delivery in patients with carcinomatosis. Recently, results from preclinical experiments suggested that Nab-PTX (Abraxane) may result in superior efficacy in the treatment of PM compared to the standard Sb-PTX formulation (Taxol). Here, we present a phase I trial of PIPAC using Nab-PTX in patients with upper gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligible patients with advanced, biopsy-proven PM from ovarian, breast, gastric, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic origin underwent three PIPAC treatments using Nab-PTX with a four-week interval. The dose of Nab-PTX was escalated from 35 to 140 mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the MTD was determined. Secondary endpoints included surgical morbidity, non-access rate, PK analyses, QoL, OS, and treatment response. Result(s): No DLT was observed in any of the five dose groups. Grade 3 thrombopenia was observed in one patient allocated to a dose of 90 mg/m2. One patient allocated to the highest dose experienced grade 3 neutropenia one week after each PIPAC. Both thrombopenia and neutropenia recovered spontaneously. The most frequent treatment-related toxicities were liver toxicity (grade 1 to 3, 75%) and anemia (grade 1 to 3, 70%). Remarkably, eight patients (40%; n=1 at 35 mg/m2, n=1 at 90 mg/m2, n=1 at 112.5 mg/m2, n=5 at 140 mg/m2) showed surgical site infections including wound infection and wound dehiscence (grade 1 to 3), four of whom required treatment with antibiotics. After PIPAC with Nab-PTX, seven (35%) responders, six (30%) non-responders and seven (35%) patients with stable PM were found. Thirteen (65%) patients combined PIPAC therapy with systemic chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): PIPAC with Nab-PTX may be applied safely up to a dose of 140 mg/m2 and in combination with systemic chemotherapy. However, at the MTD of 140 mg/m2, considerable surgical site infections and liver toxicity were observed. Therefore, the recommended dose for future phase II trials is 112.5 mg/m2. Trial registration: This clinical trial was registered in the www.clinicaltrials.gov system as NCT03304210 on 6 October 2017.Copyright © 2020

N2  -  The US and governments around the world, and companies, have made a considerable investment in nanomedicine, and there have been important discoveries. Nevertheless, there has been considerable debate as to whether the investment, both in money and in time, has been worth it. That question is not yet definitively answerable. However, investigators (and investors) might also wonder if the efforts in nanomedicine are likely to continue at the same pace as over the past decade. For this paper, an analysis was done by searching Medline, RePORT, the DOD (CDMRP), the NSF, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The major findings from the analysis are as follows: (1) The number of journal articles on the subject of nanomedicine continues to steadily rise and the areas "Drug Carriers" and "Drug Delivery Systems" are experiencing particularly rapid growth. (2) The level of funding from the Department of Health and Human Services (NIH and others) for indications other than cancer has been greater than that for cancer. (3) Funding for applications in HIV/AIDS has been strong. (4) Most of the cancers are being impacted. (5) The number of clinical trials are more highly focused in breast, skin, metastatic, and ovarian cancers, though the noncancer indications of pain and infections are also highly represented. The trials are primarily in Phases I and II, suggesting a long horizon before translating to a high impact on patients. (6) The vast majority of the clinical trials are for the evaluation of established nanomedicine formulations (liposomes and nab-paclitaxel/Abraxane) in combination with other therapies. Nevertheless, the number of clinical trials with other nanomedicine formulations has been increasing since 2009. Relatively few of the trials are for micelles or dendrimers. Taken as a whole, the analysis provides a picture that nanomedicine continues to be highly funded and highly studied but with few recent breakthroughs. Nanomedicine has yet to provide the "silver bullet" for therapy in cancer or other diseases, and it remains unclear whether it ever will.Copyright © 2020 American Chemical Society.

N2  -  Objective: To assess the anti-tumor activity and side effects of different dosages of paclitaxel (albumin binding type) (hereinafter referred to as nab-P) combined with Apatinib (hereinafter referred to as AP) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell line and xenograft models. Method(s): SKOV-3/DDP cell line was selected as the research object in cytology experiment. Firstly, we divided it into three groups for experiments to explore the individual effects of nab-P and AP. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): nab-P group, nab-P 40 mumol/l; c): AP group, AP 50 mumol/l (Drug doses were IC-50 values that detected by MTT assay). Apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl-2), vascular related protein(p-VEGFR-2), invasion related protein (MMP-2) expression were detected by Western blot and Cellular immunofluorescence, the invasion ability of tumor cells were detected by Transwell and Cell scratch test. Based on these dates, secondly, establishing different doses of nab-P combined with Ap to explore the curative effect of combination therapy. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): Group-1, nab-P 5 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, c): Group-2, nab-P 4.5 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, d): Group-3, nab-P 4 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, e): nab-P group, nab-P 5 mumol/l, f): AP group, AP 10 mumol/l (MTT assay). The combination index was analyzed by Compusyn software, Western blot, Immunofluescence, Transwell and Cell scratch test also were also chose to observe of inhibition effect. Thirdly, we used xenograft models to verify the results of cytological experiments. Tumor-forming BALB/c female nude mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, a): Control group, no drug intervention, only saline injection, b): nab-P 20 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg, c): nab-P 18 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg, d): nab-P 16 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg (The doses were guided by the pharmaceutical manufacturers). The tumor growth curve was analyzed during the experiment. And the apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl-2), angiogenesis related protein (CD31, p-VEGFR-2) and invasion related protein (MMP-2) were observed by Western blot, Immunofluescence and Immunohistochemistry to analysis the ant-tumor effects. The quality of life in nude mice were observed to analysed the drug-induced side effects. Result(s): In the separate medication section, (1) The IC-50 value of nab-P was 45.53 +/- 4.06 mumol/l, while the AP was 50.66 +/- 4.96 umol/L (48 h). (2) The expressions of bcl-2 (nab-P group, AP group), p-VEGFR-2 (AP group), MMP-2(nab-P group, AP group) were higher than Control group, while Bax (nab-P group, AP group) lower (P < 0.01). (3) The cell invasive ability was decreased after the nab-P and AP intervation (P < 0.01). In the combination medication section, (1) Compusyn showed the Combination index (Cl) were all below 1 (Cl < 1), that means nab-P and AP are synergism. (2) The combination IC-50 value was nab-P 5.28 mumol/l + AP 10.56 mumol/l (48 h). (3) In the detection of related protein expression, the combination of drugs can improve the anti-tumor effect, otherwise, after combined with AP, when nab-P were reduced dose in proper quantity, there were no obvious different in drug effect. (4) After reducing the doses of nab-P, the average food intake of nude mice increased from 4.50 g +/- 0.17 to 5.55 g +/- 0.13, and the one-hour activity increased from 6.11 min +/-0.16 to 6.34 min +/-0.13. Conclusion(s): nab-P, a chemotherapeutic agent, can play an anti-tumor role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, but it can cause adverse effects that increase with dose. When combined with AP, the two drugs have synergistic effect, which can improve the anti-tumor effects of single drug. In addition, when combined with AP, the doses of nab-P can be appropriately reduced under the standard of recommended to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs, without affecting the anti-tumor effect.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

N2  -  Background: Circular RNA (circRNA) has an essential regulatory role in the chemotherapy resistance of cancers. Nevertheless, the role of circRNA nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (circNRIP1) in the paclitaxel (PTX) resistance of ovarian cancer (OC) remains unclear. Material(s) and Method(s): The circNRIP1, miR-211-5p and homeobox C8 (HOXC8) expression levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. The PTX resistance of cells was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2-yl)-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Furthermore, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. Moreover, the protein levels of proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis-related markers and HOXC8 were determined by Western blot (WB) analysis. Tumor xenograft models were constructed to explore the influence of circNRIP1 on OC tumor growth. The interaction between miR-211-5p and circNRIP1 or HOXC8 was con-firmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Result(s): CircNRIP1 was highly expressed in PTX-resistant OC tissues and cells. Silencing of circNRIP1 repressed the PTX resistance of OC cells in vitro and OC tumor in vivo. Furthermore, circNRIP1 sponged miR-211-5p, and miR-211-5p inhibitor could reverse the inhibitory effect of circNRIP1 knockdown on the PTX resistance of OC cells. In addition, miR-211-5p targeted HOXC8, and HOXC8 overexpression could reverse the suppression effect of miR-211-5p on the PTX resistance of OC cells. Additionally, the expression of HOXC8 was regulated by circNRIP1 and miR-211-5p. Conclusion(s): CircNRIP1 silencing could inhibit the PTX resistance of OC via regulating the miR-211-5p/HOXC8 axis, showing that circNRIP1 might be a potential target for OC resistance treatment.Copyright © 2020 Li et al.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is one of the most malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, with high invasiveness. The disease is a severe threat to women's health. The ITGA2 gene, which codes for integrin subunit alpha2, is involved in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. Although previous studies have shown that ITGA2 increases in ovarian cancer, the specific molecular mechanism of how ITGA2 promotes ovarian cancer proliferation and metastasis is still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that ITGA2 was elevated in ovarian cancer, which led to poor prognosis and survival. Overexpressed ITGA2 promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. We also found that ITGA2 regulated the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by mediating AKT phosphorylation, which provided a reasonable explanation for ITGA2's role in ovarian cancer's resistance to albumin paclitaxel. In summary, ITGA2 could be used as a new therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Objective: To systematically assess the effectiveness and safety of albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel in ovarian cancer. Method(s): Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical trials about albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel and ovarian cancer in the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang and CQVIP were collected. Methodological index for non-randomized studies and modified Jadad checklists were used to assess trials. Result(s): A total of 13 clinical trials involving 488 patients were included in this study. The results of Meta-analysis showed the single agent of albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel as the second-line treatment achieved ORR was 47.3% (95%CI: 25.5%, 69.1%) and DCR was 75.9% (95%CI: 57.7%, 94.1%). When combined with platinum as the first-line treatment in advanced or the second-line treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer, ORR was 48.7% (95%CI: 26.5%, 71.0%) and DCR was 70.0% (95%CI: 50.3%, 89.7%). When combined with bevacizumab as the second-line treatment, ORR was 60.1% (95%CI: 39.7%, 80.5%) and DCR was 86.1% (95%CI: 80.4%, 91.7%). For grade 3 or 4 side effects, the incidence of leukopenia, nausea and vomiting, as well as neuropathy, were 8.4% (95%CI: -0.4%, 17.3%), 3.4% (95%CI: 0.2%, 6.5%) and 2.7%(95%CI: -0.1%, 5.5%) when treated by the single agent of albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel. Besides, the incidence of leukopenia, nausea and vomiting, as well as neuropathy, were 9.9% (95%CI: -2.2%, 21.9%), 7.7%(95%CI:2.0%, 13.3%) and 5.9%(95%CI:0.9%, 10.9%) when combined with platinum. Conclusion(s): Albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel shows effectiveness and safety in the second-line or first-line on advanced ovarian cancer in some degree and needs to be evaluated in more clinical trials.Copyright © 2020, Chinese Journal of New Drugs Co.

N2  -  Background: Pancreatic cancer is associated with a dismal prognosis, with ductal adenocarcinoma being the most common form of primary neoplasm diagnosed. Clear cell carcinoma is usually associated with kidney, ovarian or bladder malignancy but rarely associated with pancreatic malignancy. According to the WHO classification, primary clear cell adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a rare "miscellaneous" carcinoma, and to date few cases have been reported in the literature. Case: A 63-year old female who presented to a metropolitan hospital in Australia with abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis. Abdominal computed tomography subsequently demonstrated a necrotic mass in the neck of the pancreas with hepatic metastasis. Subsequent histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis was consistent with pancreatic clear cell adenocarcinoma. The patient was discharged to home to commence on dose reduced nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Conclusion(s): This case reports a rare variant of pancreatic malignancy and contributes further evidence to the body of literature highlighting clear cell adenocarcinoma as a histological subtype of pancreatic neoplasm, albeit rare in nature.Copyright © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

N2  -  Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and chemotherapy, as its main treatment, has side effects in clinical application due to lack of targeting selectivity to tumor tissues. Theranostic nanomaterials have shown wonderful functions for the diagnosis and therapy of disease benefitting from the controllability of nanomaterials. However, there is still little available for clinical transformation due to the uncertain biocompatibility. It is urgent to develop nanoprobes possessing bright transformation potentials. This study reports a facile biomineralization route to synthesize the theranostic nanoprobe using the clinic available nano-drug (trademark Abraxane). Further profiting from the binding ability of albumin to metal cations, we successfully prepared biocompatible nanoprobe, BSA-Gd2O3/PTX@Anti-HE4 mAb, for the targeted magnetic resonance imaging and chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma. The obtained nanoprobe has the advantages of uniform particle size, good dispersibility and favorable stability. In vivo and in vitro experiment results showed that the nanoprobe can realize targeted magnetic resonance imaging and chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma. Such a novel multifunctional nanoprobe based on clinic nano-drug might be promising for clinic transformation.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)

N2  -  Purpose: Family history of BRCA-related tumors may correlate with response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer. The frequency of germline mutations has been reported in patients predominantly under the age of 60 or with strong family history. We examine the incidence of deleterious germline mutations and compare the chemotherapy responses and OS in an unselected group of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Experimental Design: Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who were seen at a single cancer center between 2010 and 2016, were included. Germline DNA was sequenced using a 263-gene panel to identify novel mutations (N = 133 MD Anderson cohort, N = 127 TCGA cohort). Chemotherapy response and OS were determined by review of medical records. Result(s): Deleterious germline mutations were identified in 26 of 133 patients (19.5%). Patients with DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations (ATM, BRCA1/2, CDKN2A, CHEK2, ERCC4, PALB2, n = 15) had an improved OS as compared with patients without (16.8 vs. 9.1 months, P = 0.03). Conversely, patients with other deleterious mutations had a trend toward worse OS. However, survival in the latter group was longer (P = NS) in those mutants initially treated with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. A family history of multiple breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers was associated with DDR gene mutations and better survival. Conclusion(s): We have identified novel germline mutations that are prognostic for survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. We observe improved survival in patients with DDR gene mutations and worsened survival in patients with deleterious mutations in non-DDR genes.Copyright © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  One of the major challenges related to solvent-based taxanes administration in clinical practice is the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free, albumin-bound, paclitaxel, which minimize the risk of HSR occurrence. In this single-institution, retrospective analysis, we evaluated stage IIIc-IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, treated with first-line carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (+/- bevacizumab), after the occurrence of an HSR with solvent-based paclitaxel (and/or docetaxel). Between April 2012 and December 2018, ten patients (20.8%) received carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (+/- bevacizumab) after the occurrence of an HSR to solvent-based taxanes. Among the evaluable patients, ORR was 100%. At median follow-up of 28.5 months, median PFS was 16.7 months, and median OS was 65.4 months, respectively. Median received dose intensity (DI) was 86% and 80% of the projected DI for nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, respectively. There were no treatment-related grade 4 adverse events. Most relevant treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were: asthenia (10%), hypertransaminasemia (10%), neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and anemia (10%). No HSR recurrence was observed. The high rate of HSR occurrence could limit first-line treatment options in clinical practice. Carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel association could represent a valid treatment option in this setting.Copyright © 2019, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).

N2  -  Background: In general, there is a balance between the level of serum cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and a plasma nuclease enzyme DNase I. Tumor progression is characterized by increased levels of circulating serum cfDNA that mainly originates from dead cancer cells and active release from both tumor cells and neutrophils. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), an extracellular DNA released from neutrophils into the tumor microenvironment, as well as tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) promote pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis in many ways. For example, by modulating TLR9, triggering cancer transformation or activating metastatic genes and by inducing potent immunosuppressive effects and targeting NETs-cfDNA, the network may significantly increase the efficacy of the first-line therapy. Here we investigate the effect of the combination of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-delivered DNase I treatment (as a NET depleting agent) together with the first-line chemotherapeutic drug (nab-paclitaxel) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma mouse model. Method(s): We used BxPC-3-luc orthotopic model of BALB/c nude mice, with or without nab-paclitaxel injected systemically with the Anc80L65 AAV capsid with in-house developed hyperactive DNase I transgene cassette under a liver specific promoter(Anc80L65-DNaseI). The mice (n=8 mice/group) were monitored for tumor-associated bioluminescence, weekly. Tumor size and metastasis were assessed at the end of the study (day 28). Anc80L65's dose-response of transduction efficiency (DNaseI levels) was also assessed. Result(s): Treatment of mice with Anc80L65encoding-DNase I demonstrated a significant decrease in tumor bioluminescence (by more than 53%) compared to untreated control (p < 0.05). The number of ovary, kidney, spleen, and liver metastatic cells were significantly lower in the group treated with Nab-paclitaxel + Anc80L65-DnaseI vector than in both the untreated control group and the group treated only with Nab-paclitaxel (p<0.05). Anc80L65-DNaseI enabled a significant increase in serum DNase I levels compared to untreated controls. Conclusion(s): This study shows a potential in the cancer therapeutic strategy employing a gene-therapy approach allowing long-term expression of DNase I and destruction of NETs and tumor derived cfDNA.Copyright © 2020

N2  -  Preclinical studies have shown that GR activation leads to decreased response to antimetabolites, taxanes, and platinum agents, while GR inhibition enhances therapeutic efficacy. The novel, selective GR antagonist ORIC-101 is under clinical evaluation in combination with anticancer therapies. In this study we set out to assess which cancer types and chemotherapeutics are responsive to combination with ORIC-101. Specifically, we employed caspase assays, in vitro and in vivo tumor growth inhibition studies, and transcriptional profiling in a panel of preclinical models spanning triple-negative breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancers, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma, and renal cell carcinoma. We found that ORIC-101 reverses GR-mediated antiapoptosis effects towards diverse chemotherapeutics, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin, across the seven cancer types. Furthermore, ORIC-101 completely overcomes GR-driven chemoprotection and tumor growth in colony formation assays in vitro and in xenograft studies in vivo. At the molecular level, transcriptional profiling and pathway enrichment analysis showed that ORIC-101 fully reverses GR-activated pathways that are directly involved in drug resistance, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and antiapoptosis, supporting a pan-cancer role of GR as a mediator of therapy resistance. Altogether, ORIC-101, a selective and potent GR antagonist, overcomes resistance to common chemotherapeutics across multiple cancer models. Clinical evaluation of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel is currently ongoing in advanced solid tumors.

N2  -  Background: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies. Here, we examined tumoral proteome changes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to identify potential predictive and prognostic biomarkers of response to primary chemotherapy. Method(s): A total of 65 tissue specimens from 10 patients with advanced-stage HGSOC were collected from matched pre-and post-NACT (3 cycles of dose-dense paclitaxel and carboplatin). Protein expression was assessed using reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA). All relative protein levels using 297 antibodies were normalized by the expression level of pre-treatment samples, and then protein expression alterations and functional analyses were performed by Reactome pathway analysis followed by statistical analysis. Result(s): The protein expression patterns of samples tended to cluster according to the time point (pre-and post-treatment) by a non-supervised clustering analysis using all the proteins assessed in the RPPA panel. Five differentially expressed proteins among 239 proteins (adj. p<0.1, log2FC>=1) were identified by RPPA. We identified XBP1, MYH11, and S100A4 as being upregulated and CCNB1 and TFRC were down-regulated post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. We also observed significant enrichment of specific functional and signaling pathways by pathway analysis; these included PI3K/AKT signaling, necrosis and programmed cell death (upregulated, p<0.05, FDR<1), and cell cycle and homology-directed repair (HDR) through homologous recombination repair and G2/M checkpoints (down-regulated, p<0.02, FDR<0.5) in post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. Interestingly, cell cycle, DNA damage, and G2 checkpoint pathways at post-treatment exhibited significantly lower pathway scores than pre-treatment. Conclusion(s): Our findings identified significant proteomic alterations following NACT, and could provide insights into interval proteomic alterations following induction chemotherapy in advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients. These data present information to optimize future clinical trial designs for patients with ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Background: In KEYNOTE-407, 1L pembro + carboplatin-(nab)paclitaxel (chemo) significantly improved OS in metastatic sqNSCLC. The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib improved outcomes as maintenance therapy vs placebo in platinum-sensitive, newly diagnosed BRCA1/BRCA2-mutated (BRCAm) ovarian cancer and relapsed/recurrent BRCAm/BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer, suggesting efficacy in tumors with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) regardless of BRCAm. High HRD scores in NSCLC suggest potential benefit with olaparib maintenance in pts with NSCLC. KEYLYNK-008 (NCT03976362) evaluates pembro +/- maintenance olaparib after pembro + chemo induction as 1L treatment in pts with metastatic sqNSCLC. Trial design: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study enrolls pts >=18 y with treatment-naive histologically/cytologically confirmed metastatic sqNSCLC, with measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), ECOG PS 0/1, and a tumor tissue sample evaluable for PD-L1. All pts (~735) receive 4 cycles of pembro 200 mg + carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 or nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 Q3W. Pts with CR, PR, or SD after cycle 4 (~566 pts) are randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W (up to 31 cycles) + maintenance olaparib 300 mg or placebo BID, stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PD-L1 TPS (<50% vs >=50%), and response at randomization (CR/PR vs SD). Tumor imaging (RECIST v1.1; 10 total target lesions max, 5/organ) by central review (BICR) occurs at baseline and Q6W up to wk 48, then Q9W until verified PD, start of new anticancer therapy, or study withdrawal. AEs throughout the study up to 30 days (serious AEs, 90 days) after discontinuing treatment are graded by NCI CTCAE v4.0. Primary endpoints are PFS (RECIST v1.1 by BICR) and OS analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and stratified log-rank test, with HRs per stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's tie handling method. Safety and patient reported outcomes are secondary endpoints; ORR and duration of response are exploratory endpoints. Enrollment began on June 28, 2019 at 162 sites in 20 countries.

N2  -  Background: Selinexor is a first-in-class novel, oral potent selective inhibitor of nuclear export which blocks the transport protein called Exportin-1. Carboplatin+ Taxol (CT) is one of the standard chemotherapy regimens used in various tumour types. Preclinical models have suggested that selinexor and CT exerts antitumor activity in multiple malignancies. Method(s): This was an open label, single-center, multi-arm phase Ib study utilizing a "3 + 3" design and a "basket type" expansion. CT + selinexor was employed as one of the 13 parallel arms. Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours who were unresponsive or had relapsed following prior systemic therapy or where the addition of selinexor to standard chemotherapy deemed appropriate and acceptable, were eligible. Result(s): Of 13 patients treated, 12 patients were evaluable for response. The most common cancers were breast (n=4), esophageal (n=2), ovarian (n=2) and non-small cell lung cancers (n=2). All 13 patients had at least one treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) and the commonest TEAE were anemia (84%), neutropenia (84%), leukopenia (84%), thrombocytopenia (84%), fatigue (61%), elevated AST or ALT (61%), nausea (53%), hypomagnesemia (53%), and peripheral motor or sensory neuropathy (53%). The most prevalent grade >= 3 TEAE were neutropenia (69%), thrombocytopenia (53%), leukopenia (46%), and anemia (15%). One patient at 60mg once weekly had experienced DLT with grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days. Partial response was noted in 4 patients (33.3%) in patients with esophageal (n=2), 1 patient each with breast and ovarian cancer. Five patients (41.7%) achieved stable disease and the clinical benefit rate was 75%. Majority of patients (84%), including 3 patients who had PR, had prior exposure to carboplatin and/ or paclitaxel. Treatment time to failure (TTF) ranged from 10 to 148 weeks and TTF for patients with PR was from 18 to 23 weeks. Conclusion(s): Oral selinexor can be safely combined with CT and the RP2D was 60 mg once weekly in combination with CT. The combination conferred appreciable clinical activity with durable objective responses which should further be explored in tumour types for which CT is used as standard of care.

N2  -  Background: Pyrotinib have improved clinical outcomes in HER-2 positive breast cancer and are explored as potential treatments for HER-2 positive/mutations tumors other than breast cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib for the treatment of the patients with HER-2 positive/mutations tumors other than breast cancer in clinical practice. Method(s): This is a multicentre, retrospective study. The clinical data of patients with HER-2 positive/mutations tumors excluding breast cancer were collected in 14 hospitals in Suzhou and Wuxi City from September 2018 to May 2019. Patients historically confirmed overexpression of HER-2 protein by ICH3+/ISH+ or HER-2 mutations on targeted NGS was included. All patients received any regimens based on pyrotinib. Result(s): Total 25 pts with HER-2 positive/mutations were enrolled. The median age was 64 years (range 37-73 years). There were 10 lung cancer, 9 gastric cancer, 2 colorectal cancer, 2 thymic cancer, 1 ovarian cancer and 1 gallbladder cancer. Patients received pyrotinib as <3rd-line therapy, 3rd-line therapy, >3rd-line therapy accounted for 20% (5), 56% (14), and 24% (6), respectively. Seven pts received pyrotinib monotherapy, 18 pts received combination therapy, including 11 combined with capecitabine, 2 with albumin-bound paclitaxel, 1 with trastuzumab, 1 with osimertinib, 1 with bevacizumab,1 with pemetrexed, and 1 with irinotecan. 21 (84.0%) pts received 400 mg pyrotinib once daily as initial dose, 2 (8%) pts received 320 mg, 2 (8%) pts received 160 mg. Total 23 pts were eligible for efficacy evaluation, 12 pts achieved PR (4 pts with lung cancer, 4 pts with gastric cancer, 2 pts with colorectal cancer, 2 pts with thymic cancer), 9 pts were SD and 2 pts were PD. The ORR was 52.2% and the DCR was 91.3%. The mPFS was 3.5 months (95%CI: 2.2-5.0 months), mOS was 9.6 months (95%CI: 4.4 months-NR). The main AE was diarrhea in 23 (92%) cases, Grade 1-2 diarrhea were recored in 18 (72.0%) cases, and 5 (20%) cases reported grade 3 diarrhea. Conclusion(s): The retrospective study showed that pyrotinib showed good efficacy and safety in patients with HER-2 positive/mutation solid tumors, not only in HER-2 positive breast cancer. Prospective studies are warranted to further confirm its efficacy and safety. Legal entity responsible for the study: JunQian.

N2  -  Background: Our previous phase I study with MPTK-CAR-T (mesothelin-directed 28zeta CAR-T cells with PD-1 and TCR disruption by CRISPR-Cas9 system) demonstrated feasibility and safety of CRISPR-mediated PD-1 inactivation in CAR-T cells, and suggested the natural TCR is beneficial for the proliferation of CAR-T cells in solid tumors. Based on these observations, we initiated a pilot dose escalation study to investigate mesothelin-directed CAR-T cells with only PD-1 disruption by CRISPR (termed as GC008t) in patients with mesothelinpositive advanced solid tumors (NCT03747965). Method(s): On the data cut-off date (Jan 20, 2020), nine patients (6 pancreatic cancers, 2 ovarian cancers, 1 colorectal cancer) were treated (5 received >=12 numbers of therapy), three in cohort 1 (0.1-0.2x10 /kg), four in cohort 2 (0.5-1.0x10 /kg), two in cohort 3 (2.5-5x10 /kg). Eight of the 9 patients received lymphodepletion regimen of cyclophosphamide and nab-paclitaxel with or without gemcitabine. Four of the 9 patients received repeat infusions of GC008t per protocol. Result(s): Comparable proliferation capacity was observed in vitro between the MPTK-CAR-T and the GC008t products. The mean PD-1 surface expression in cell products was 0.5% (range, 0.2%-0.9%). GC008t infusions were well tolerated with no observed on-target/off-tumor toxicity, autoimmune activity. Only two patients in cohort 3 developed grade 1 CRS with fever and rash. Circulating GC008t expanded with a peak at day 7-14 and became undetectable by qPCR beyond 1 month. The mean peak levels of circulating CAR-T cells between GC008t and MPTK-CAR-T at similar dose level were not statistically significant. Failure of GC008t engraftment after repeat infusion was observed in 2 out of 4 patients. The best response of the 7 evaluable patients was stable disease in 4 and partial response in 2 patients (dosed >= 1x10 /kg) with PFS of 80 and 160 days. Conclusion(s): Phase I trial of GC008t further establishes that genetic inactivation of PD-1 in CAR-T cells by CRISPR is feasible and safe. The expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells with PD-1 disruption is not improved significantly even in the setting of natural TCR and lymphodepletion. Future endeavors are needed to improve the clinical efficacy of CAR-T therapy in the treatment of solid tumor.

N2  -  Background: Approximately 70% patients with advanced ovarian cancer have a relapse and ultimately succumb to their disease. Treatment options are limited in this context with an unacceptable low response (less than 20%). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors presented to date are not very convincing with 10-15% response because of inadequate immunity. We previously discovered the critical role of manganese in innate immune sensing of tumors by activating STING signaling. This ongoing, randomized, phase II study is to assess STING agonist plus nPP chemotherapy and anti-PD-1 antibody sintilimab in platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. Method(s):Enrolled patients were 2:1 randomizedly assigned to receive nab-paclitaxel (180-220mg/m2 ), cisplatin (60-80mg/m2 ) and sintilimab 200mg per 3 weeks with (cohort 1) or without (cohort 2) inhalable MnCl (0.4mg/kg) daily. Safety was assessed by CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response by MRI or CT every 2 cycles referred to RECIST version 1.1. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Key secondary end points were disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): 27 patients were enrolled, and 21 were included in efficacy population by the end of Jan. 2020. All enrolled patients were with heavily treated history, median 4 lines of prior therapy, median 19 cycles of multiagent regimens. The addition of MnCl to the combined chemoimmunotherapy did not appear to exacerbate treatment-related adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs are hematological toxicity (87%), nausea (56%) and vomiting (47%) in both two cohorts. All 14 evaluable patients (14/19) from cohort 1 had an effective control (11 PR [78.6%], 3 SD [21.4%]) . Ten patients (71.4%) achieved PR at the first tumor scan assessment. For 8 cases from cohort 2, 7 were assessable and all showed SD, 4 of whom exhibited SD with enlarged lesions and disease progression after 4-cycle treatment. Conclusion(s): MnCl administration induced encouraging objective clinical responses (78.6%) and disease control (100%) in relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer. The combined regimen showed accepted and manageable safety profile.

N2  -  Purpose: About 70-80% of patients with ovarian cancer will relapse after chemotherapy. The prognosis is poor and the management of relapsed ovarian cancer remains a difficult problem. Treating them is challenging and many controversies remain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization in the treatment for recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): Transarterial chemoembolization was tried in total 32 patients (Sep.2014~Sep.2018) with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer. Evaluation before treatment includes CA125 and imaging with CT or MRI or PET-CT. Transarterial infusion via feeding arteries using chemoagents (gemcitabine, oxaliplatine, cisplatin, abraxane, bevacizumab, ifosfamide, adriamycin, glycirrhyzinic acid) was repeated every 4~8 weeks, according to the patients' response and clinical condition. Additional embolization with imipenem-induced microparticles(40~50mum) was performed when the lesions were highly vascular and safe for embolotherapy. CA125, imaging study and changes in symptom were evaluated again after every treatment. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in all of the 32 patients. Improvement of symptoms and decrease in CA125 level was demonstrated in 27 patients. The time to max clinical improvement ranged 3~7 days. The duration maintaining clinical improvement ranged 4~7 weeks. And decline in CA125 level is well correlated with the target lesion response by RECIST. Procedure related complications were not demonstrated in all patients. Conclusion(s): Transarterial chemoembolization in the treatment for recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer achieves a high local response and good symptom control. It is safe and can be a meaningful treatment option for relapsed ovarian cancer patient to control disease progression and symptom palliation.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is commonly diagnosed only after it has metastasized to the abdominal cavity (stage III). While the current standard of care of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of cisplatin and paclitaxel (PTX) combination chemotherapy has benefit, patient 5-year survival rates are low and have not significantly improved in the past decade. The ability to target chemotherapy selectively to ovarian tumors while sparing normal tissue would improve efficacy and decrease toxicities. We have previously shown that cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) loaded within neural stem cells (NSCs) are selectively delivered to ovarian tumors in the abdominal cavity following IP injection, with no evidence of localization to normal tissue. Here we extended the capabilities of this system to also include PTX delivery. NPs that will be loaded into NSCs must contain a high amount of drug by weight but constrain the release of the drug such that the NSCs are viable after loading and can successfully migrate to tumors. We developed silica coated PTX nanocrystals (Si[PTX-NC]) meeting these requirements. Si[PTX-NC] were more effective than uncoated PTX-NC or Abraxane for loading NSCs with PTX. NSCs loaded with Si[PTX-NC] maintained their migratory ability and, for low dose PTX, were more effective than free PTX-NC or Si[PTX-NC] at killing ovarian tumors in vivo. This work demonstrates that NSC/NP delivery is a platform technology amenable to delivering different therapeutics and enables the pursuit of NSC/NP targeted delivery of the entire preferred chemotherapy regimen for ovarian cancer. It also describes efficient silica coating chemistry for PTX nanocrystals that may have applications beyond our focus on NSC transport.Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society.

N2  -  Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be used for tumor-specific delivery of small molecular weight anticancer drugs by using nanoparticle-encapsulated forms of the drugs. Current approaches to incorporate nanoparticles in MSCs rely on nonspecific endocytosis of nanoparticles or their conjugation to the cell surface via endogenous amines and thiols. These methods result in sub-optimal drug loading, which hinders the widespread application of MSCs as drug carriers. An advanced nanoengineering strategy is reported here that involves generation of MSCs expressing azide functional groups on their surface and conjugation of dibenzyl cyclooctyne-functionalized nanoparticles to the azide groups using copper-free click chemistry. This novel strategy significantly improves the payload capacity of MSCs (=48 pg of paclitaxel (PTX) per cell) relative to that reported previously (<1-20 pg per cell), without affecting their native phenotype. In vivo, the nanoengineered MSCs significantly inhibit tumor growth (p < 0.05) and improve survival (p < 0.0001) compared to free or nanoparticle encapsulated PTX and Abraxane in an orthotopic ovarian tumor model. In summary, the nanoengineering strategy reported here allows for improved delivery and anticancer efficacy of conventional chemotherapeutic agents using MSCs as drug carriers.Copyright © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

N2  -  Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BEV) combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP) in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. Method(s): Eighty-six patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer admitted to our hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups: BEV+ABP group (n=43, treated with BEV combined with ABP) and ABP group (n=43, treated with ABP alone). The clinical objective response rate (ORR), changes in serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) level and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Additionally, the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated after treatment. Result(s): The clinical ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 86.0% (37/43) and 93.0% (40/43) in BEV+ABP group and 62.8% (27/43) and 79.1% (34/43) in ABP group, respectively. The clinical ORR of patients exhibited a statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.025), which was overtly higher in the BEV + ABP group than in ABP group, while the DCR had no statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.117). The serum CA125 level was evidently decreased in both groups after treatment (p<0.05) compared with that before treatment, but without significant difference between two groups after treatment (p=0.220). The major adverse reactions were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reactions, alopecia, rash, fatigue and peripheral neurotoxicity. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse reactions between two groups (p>0.05). All patients were followed up for 6-29 months. The median OS was 16.3 and 12.6 months in BEV + ABP group and ABP group, respectively, clearly longer in BEV + ABP group than in ABP group (p=0.007). The median PFS in BEV + ABP group was clearly longer than in ABP group (8.9 vs. 6.7 months, p=0.028). Conclusion(s): In comparison with ABP alone, BEV combined with ABP in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer improves the clinical efficacy, PFS and OS, with good tolerance, and is worthy of popularization and application in clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 Zerbinis Publications.

N2  -  Timosaponin AIII (TAIII), a steroidal saponin isolated from the rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides, exerted cytotoxic effect in many cancer cell lines. However, the effect of TAIII on resistant tumor cancer cells was unclear. In this study, MTT assay showed that TAIII exhibited significant cytotoxicity against A549/Taxol and A2780/Taxol cells in vitro. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining revealed that TAIII induced apoptosis in A549/T and A2780/T cells. Furthermore, Western blot analysis demonstrated that TAIII inhibited the expressions of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as well as Ras, Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEPK), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) in two taxol-resistant cancer cell lines. Besides, in vivo studies demonstrated that TAIII inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model. Additionally, TAIII (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) also down-regulated the protein expressions of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways in vivo. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that TAIII exhibited significant anti-tumor effect on taxol-resistant cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is often sensitive to initial treatment with platinum and taxane combination chemotherapy, but most patients relapse with chemotherapy- resistant disease. To systematically identify genes modulating chemotherapy response, we performed pooled functional genomic screens in HGSOC cell lines treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel, or cisplatin plus paclitaxel. Genes in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis were among the top candidate resistance genes in both gain-of-function and loss-of-function screens. In an open reading frame overexpression screen, followed by a mini-pool secondary screen, anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) and BCL2L2 (BCL-W) were associated with chemotherapy resistance. In a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, loss of BCL2L1 decreased cell survival whereas loss of proapoptotic genes promoted resistance. To dissect the role of individual anti-apoptotic proteins in HGSOC chemotherapy response, we evaluated overexpression or inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and MCL1 in HGSOC cell lines. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins decreased apoptosis and modestly increased cell viability upon cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, specific inhibitors of BCL-XL, MCL1, or BCL-XL/BCL-2, but not BCL-2 alone, enhanced cell death when combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Anti-apoptotic protein inhibitors also sensitized HGSOC cells to the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib. These unbiased screens highlight anti-apoptotic proteins as mediators of chemotherapy resistance in HGSOC, and support inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL1, alone or combined with chemotherapy or targeted agents, in treatment of primary and recurrent HGSOC.Copyright © 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  The poor solubility of paclitaxel (PTX), the most commonly used anticancer drug (Taxol), has long hindered the development of successful formulations. In 2005, the launch of Abraxane, a human albumin-based preparation of PTX, competed with Taxol in the commercial market. The success of Abraxane pushed other generic preparations aside, sparking competition among the global pharmaceutical companies to develop the novel and superior PTX nanotechnology-driven formulations. Unsurprisingly, the success underlying with cancer treatment using nano PTX therapy has now entered into a new era of drug development, patentability, preclinical and clinical evaluation, leading eventually to a significant increase in the regulatory approval of the products. The present article aims to provide recent progress in the development of nano PTX formulations by various pharmaceutical companies for safe and effective drug therapies for patients benefit.Copyright © 2019 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  -  Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common reason for dose reduction or early cessation of therapy. Nab-paclitaxel was developed to provide additional clinical benefits and overcome the safety drawbacks of solvent-based paclitaxel. However, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy induced by nab-paclitaxel was reported higher than solvent-based paclitaxel but evidence remains inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy between nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based paclitaxel mono-chemotherapy. In total, 24 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Results revealed the incidence of peripheral neuropathy induced by nab-paclitaxel was higher than solvent-based paclitaxel. The dosage and assessment method could influence the comparison of the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy between nab-paclitaxel and solvent-based paclitaxel. Current evidence suggests the incidence of peripheral neuropathy induced by nab-paclitaxel was higher than solvent-based paclitaxel among cancer patients received mono-chemotherapy. When received nab-paclitaxel, more attention should be paid to peripheral neuropathy.Copyright © 2019

N2  -  Rationale:Pancreatic cancer (PC) is considered as one of the deadliest cancers all over the world. Germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations have been widely studied in breast and ovarian carcinomas as they have been found to enhance the risk for disease progression. Olaparib, an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment strategy of ovarian cancer with any BRCA1/2 mutations. There is a lack of studies which focus on the treatment of other cancer with BRCA-Mutation.Patient concerns:This report describes a patient whose presenting complaints were "Physical examination showed that the pancreas was occupied for one month." He initially was diagnosed with stage IV PC based on conventional imaging and pathologic assessment. He had a known germline BRCA 2 mutation, which exhibited a good response to PARP inhibitor therapy.Diagnosis:Through the biopsy histopathological examination, imaging examination, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed as metastatic PC with BRCA2 mutation. Intervention(s):He received gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy from March 15, 2017 to June 30, 2017, and Nivolumab immunotherapy as the maintenance therapy. After serum CA-199 level increased, Olaparib was orally administered from August 17, 2017 to March. After tumor relapsed, he received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including Trametinib Oxaliplatin, S-1, bevacizumab, and irinotecan liposome injection till July 17, 2018. Outcome(s):We observed the patient had a good progression-free survival (7.4 months); the lesion of the pancreas was classified as partial disease through Olaparib treatment, which indicated significant shrinkage. But it is difficult to conclude whether such therapy could help prolong the overall survival for such patients.Lessons:The targeted therapy Olaparib showed early signs of potential in treating PC in patients with mutations of the BRCA genes. With emerging therapeutic modalities and next-generation sequencing development, it is increasingly relevant to consider mutation screenings of patients with PC.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

N2  -  Nineteen topics were selected as major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology in 2018. For cervical cancer, the importance of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone as primary cervical cancer screening method and negative survival impact of minimally invasive surgery in early-stage cervical cancer were addressed. For ovarian cancer, cost-effectiveness of genetic testing to prevent cancer, use of analgesics and oral pill to reduce cancer risk, efficacy of secondary cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, update in the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and efficacy of anti-angiogenic targeted treatments, including bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were reviewed. For corpus cancer, sentinel lymph node mapping technique, adjuvant therapy in high-risk endometrial cancer (PORTEC-3), and targeted therapy in recurrent disease were covered. For the field of radiation oncology, survival outcomes of chemoradiation compared with chemotherapy alone in metastatic cervical cancer and new findings regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer were introduced. Lastly, for breast cancer, the use of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation, ovarian suppression for premenopausal patients, adjuvant chemotherapy guided by 21-gene assay, and combination therapy of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel for triple-negative cancer as well as promising overall survival results of palbociclib and fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer were briefly mentioned.Copyright © 2019.

N2  -  Surgery and chemotherapy are the gold-standard treatments for ovarian cancer. The major cause of treatment failure in patients with ovarian cancer is tumoral heterogeneity and drug resistance. Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most commonly used first-line drugs for ovarian cancer chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of post-translational neddylation on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) to PTX-induced apoptosis. Disruption of protein neddylation with the first-in-class inhibitor MLN4924 dramatically neutralized PTX-mediated antiproliferative, antimigration, and apoptotic effects in human OCCs. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment interrupted PTX-induced microtubule polymerization. Importantly, two neddylation conjugating E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, were found to play essential roles in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and tubulin polymerization in OCCs. In summary, our findings demonstrated that disruption of protein neddylation by MLN4924 conferred resistance to PTX and provided insights into the potential mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2018 The Authors

N2  -  Background and Aims: Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors with a high reoccurrence and chemoresistance. The key mechanism relationship with chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma is still unclear. The existence of cancer stem cells involves in chemoresistance and reoccurrence in OC. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression, suppression of malignant properties and reversal of paclitaxel resistance inhibiting RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 with siRNA in ovarian cancer cells. Method(s): The expression of MSI-1 was analyzed in 39 normal ovarian epithelia tissues, 92 serous cystadenomas, 68 borderline serous cystadenomas, and 97 serous cystadenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry. pLKO.1-MSI-1-siRNA expression vector was transfected into ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and its paclitaxel-resistant cell subline A2780/Taxol. The roles of MSI-1 in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were explored by cell proliferation analysis, Caspase 3 activity assay, wound healing assay, migration and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Western Blotting and Real-time quantitative PCR were conducted to detect the expression of MSI-1 and the ERK signaling pathway. Reversal of paclitaxel resistance assay was used to evaluate the role of MSI-1 in paclitaxel resistance of OC cells. Finally, therapeutic effects of MSI-1 inhibition were investigated the xenogratfs of SCID mice in vivo of the paclitacel-resistant. Result(s): MSI-1 is overexpressed and associated with an unfavorable prognosis in OC patients. Knockdown of MSI-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and reduces migration and invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, MSI-1 expression inhibition reverses paclitaxel-resistance in OC cells. We further display that MSI-1 effectively protects OC cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of p-Bcl-2 through ERK signaling pathway activation. In vivo, MSI-1 siRNA clearly showed a strong effect on tumor growth inhibition and paclitaxel-resistance reversal. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that MSI-1 overexpression is associated with the prognosis of OC patients, and knockdown of MSI-1 can suppress malignant properties and reverse paclitaxel-resistance in OC cells. MSI-1 maybe act as a potential prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target in OC.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.

N2  -  We report here that the androgen receptor (AR) and ABCB1 are upregulated in a model of acquired taxol resistance (txr) in ovarian carcinoma cells. AR silencing sensitizes txr cells to taxol threefold, whereas ectopic AR expression in AR-null HEK293 cells induces resistance to taxol by 1.7-fold. AR activation using the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or sublethal taxol treatment upregulates ABCB1 expression in both txr cells and AR-expressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, AR inactivation using the antagonist bicalutamide downregulates ABCB1 expression and enhances cytotoxicity to taxol. A functional ABCB1 promoter containing five predicted androgen-response elements (AREs) is cloned. Deletion assays reveal a taxol-responsive promoter segment which harbors ARE4. Notably, DHT- or taxol-activated AR potentiates binding of the AR to ARE4 as revealed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, txr cells display an increase in chromatin remodeling. AR/H3K9ac and AR/H3K14ac complexes bind specifically to ARE4 in response to taxol. Furthermore, acetyltransferase protein levels (p300 and GCN5) are upregulated in txr cells. Silencing of p300 or GCN5 reduces chromatin modification and enhances cytotoxicity in both parental and txr SKOV3 cells. While the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway is significantly activated by taxol, taxol-induced ABCB1 expression, histone posttranslational modifications, and p300 binding to ARE4 are suppressed following inhibition of the PI3K/AKT cellular pathway. These results demonstrate that the AKT/p300/AR axis can be activated to target ABCB1 gene expression in response to taxol, thus revealing a new treatment target to counter taxol resistance.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  UNC-45A, a highly conserved member of the UCS (UNC45A/CRO1/SHE4P) protein family of cochaperones, plays an important role in regulating cytoskeletal-associated functions in invertebrates and mammalian cells, including cytokinesis, exocytosis, cell motility, and neuronal development. Here, for the first time, UNC-45A is demonstrated to function as a mitotic spindle-associated protein that destabilizes microtubules (MT) activity. Using in vitro biophysical reconstitution and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy analysis, we reveal that UNC-45A directly binds to taxol-stabilized MTs in the absence of any additional cellular cofactors or other MT-associated proteins and acts as an ATP-independent MT destabilizer. In cells, UNC-45A binds to and destabilizes mitotic spindles, and its depletion causes severe defects in chromosome congression and segregation. UNC-45A is overexpressed in human clinical specimens from chemoresistant ovarian cancer and that UNC-45A-overexpressing cells resist chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy when treated with clinically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel. Lastly, UNC-45A depletion exacerbates paclitaxel-mediated stabilizing effects on mitotic spindles and restores sensitivity to paclitaxel. Implications: These findings reveal novel and significant roles for UNC-45A in regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, broadening our understanding of the basic mechanisms regulating MT stability and human cancer susceptibility to paclitaxel, one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents for the treatment of human cancers.Copyright © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Purpose: To evaluate intraperitoneal (IP) nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies that are primarily confined to the peritoneal cavity in a phase I trial. Method(s): Using a 3 + 3 dose escalation of IP nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, we evaluated six dose levels (35-175 mg/m2/dose). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IP nab-paclitaxel were determined. Result(s): There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cohorts 1-3. There was a DLT in one of six patients in cohort 4 (112.5 mg/m2) (grade 3 neutropenia causing treatment delay > 15 days) and a DLT in one of three patients in cohort 6 (175 mg/m2) (grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 abdominal pain). A second patient in cohort 6 experienced a serious adverse event (cycle 1, grade 4 ANC <= 7 days, cycle 4, grade 2 left ventricular dysfunction). This dose level was determined to be above the MTD. No DLTs were seen in seven patients treated in cohort 5 (140 mg/m2). The MTD of IP nab-paclitaxel was established at 140 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. There was a PK advantage for IP nab-paclitaxel, with an IP plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio of 147-fold (range 50-403) and therapeutic range systemic drug levels. Eight of 27 enrolled patients had progression-free survival >= 6 months. One patient experienced complete response, and one patient experienced partial response. Six patients had stable disease. Conclusion(s): Weekly IP nab-paclitaxel has a favorable toxicity profile, a significant pharmacologic advantage, and promising clinical activity.

N2  -  Background: A family and personal history of breast (B), ovarian(O), and pancreatic(P) cancer was reported to be a predictive marker in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We planned a prospective phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of platinum-based chemotherapy in this population. Method(s): Eligible patients had chemotherapy-naive metastatic PA, had one or more of the followings: 1) at least one family history of P/B/O/prostate (PR) cancer in a first-degree relative, 2) at least two family members with history of P/B/O/PR cancer within third-degree relatives, and 3) at least one personal history of B/O/PR cancer.Patient suitable for FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel were ineligible unless patient refuse those regimens. Patients received gemcitabine 1000mg/m2and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 every two weeks (GEMOX). The primary endpoint was the one-year survival rate and 44% were desired. The sample size was calculated to be 43 pts, with a one-sided alpha of 5% and a power of 80%. Result(s): A total of 45 pts were enrolled. First 43 pts were included in primary analysis. One-year survival rate was 27.9 [90%CI;17.0-41.3]% and didn't met pre-planned boundary. Response rate was 27.9%. Tendency of prolonged survival was observed in patients with two or more family histories of P/B/O/PR cancer (HR 0.65, 95%CI [0.34-1.23]). Family history or personal history with B/O/PR cancer tended to be associate with better response and prolonged survival. In this study, patient with family history of pancreatic cancer seemed to be associate with poor response. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (23%) and elevated level of ALT (20%). Treatment related death was not observed. Conclusion(s): GEMOX did not show expected efficacy in patients with metastatic PA with family history or personal history of P/B/O/PR cancer.Copyright © 2019 European Society for Medical Oncology

N2  -  The BRCA gene is mainly studied in the field of hereditary breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer, and it is well-known that cancer patients with BRCA mutation are highly sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. We report a pancreatic cancer patient with BRCA1 mutation who was respond to modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) treatment after gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) refractory. The patient is a 65-year-old male with ECOG performance status 0. He has family history of breast cancer in mother and sister. His father had malignant lymphoma. He was diagnosed as pancreatic head cancer and underwent pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy at another hospital. During adjuvant therapy using S-1 after surgery, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) value was elevated and enhanced CT revealed multiple liver metastases. Although he received GnP as the first-line chemotherapy, progressive disease of liver metastases was confirmed after 2 cycles of GnP. He examined BRCA genes, because he had a family history of breast cancer. As a result, BRCA1 mutation was found. After disease progression of GnP, he was referred to our hospital for treatment with FFX. He received mFFX, and 62% tumor reduction was observed after 4 cycles of mFFX. A partial response was achieved, and CEA value was fallen to within normal range. The maximum tumor reduction rate was 81%; two metastatic lesions disappeared and one lesion remained. mFFX was switched to FOLFIRI at the 33th cycle because of peripheral neuropathy. CEA value was re-elevated 23 months after the beginning of mFFX, and FOLFIRI was changed to mFFX again. However, CEA value was elevated more, and CT revealed regrowth of one metastatic lesion. Three months later, no other metastatic lesion was detected on CT images, and he underwent hepatctomy. He is alive without recurrence 2 months after hepatectomy.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: A 38-year-old Caucasian female with a history of stage IV clear cell carcinoma of the ovaries with metastasis to the liver presented with anemia. The patient presented to clinic for evaluation of symptomatic tachycardia and shortness of breath. She was found to have a hemoglobin of 6.2 at that time. On further questioning, the patient stated that she had been having bloody diarrhea for several days which had gradually been improving. She endorsed some lower abdominal pain along with increased swelling in her abdomen. The patient was admitted for a GI bleed at that time. The patient was on treatment with Abraxane and Carboplatin and was due for a second cycle, which was delayed due to significant cytopenias. CASE DESCRIPTION/METHODS: A colonoscopy was performed and the patient was found to have two ulcerated masses at 40 and 20 cm from the anal verge which were biopsied. CT chest abdomen pelvis was done upon admission and showed liver lesions, pelvic lymphadenopathy, small right ischiorectal fossa nodule and subcutaneous lesions concerning for metastatic disease. There were also lesions seen adjacent to the bladder concerning for drop metastasis. The patient also had a gastrograffin enema and was found to have scalloping of the margin of the distal sigmoid colon concerning for a mass. The pathology report and immunochemical stain evaluation revealed the adenocarcinoma to be positive for cytokeratin 7, negative for cytokeratin 20, negative for CDX2, and negative for WT-1 which argued against a colorectal primary. Surgical biopsy and pathology were also consistent with metastatic clear cell ovarian cancer. The patient did have an elevated CA-125 of 440.3. DISCUSSION: Four percent of ovarian carcinoma metastases are to the colorectal region. Isolated rectal metastasis is even more rare. Immunochemical stains are helpful in determining the primary lesion and source of malignancy. Cytokeratin 7 positive and cytokeratin 20 negative immunostaining is almost 100% specific for primary ovarian origin.1 The patient was transfused blood and her hemoglobin improved with no further bleeding and she was discharged home. She was started on Carboplatin-Taxol every 3 weeks for six cycles and was going to be tested for the BRCA gene. (Figure Presented).

N2  -  Background: A family and personal history of breast (B), ovarian(O), and pancreatic(P) cancer was reported to be a predictive marker in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PA) treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. We planned a prospective phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of platinum-based chemotherapy in this population. Method(s): Eligible patients had chemotherapy-naive metastatic PA, had one or more of the followings: 1) at least one family history of P/B/O/prostate (PR) cancer in a firstdegree relative, 2) at least two family members with history of P/B/O/PR cancer within third-degree relatives, and 3) at least one personal history of B/O/PR cancer.Patient suitable for FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel were ineligible unless patient refuse those regimens. Patients received gemcitabine 1000mg/m2and oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 every two weeks (GEMOX). The primary endpoint was the one-year survival rate and 44% were desired. The sample size was calculated to be 43 pts, with a onesided alpha of 5% and a power of 80%. Result(s): A total of 45 pts were enrolled. First 43 pts were included in primary analysis. One-year survival rate was 27.9 [90%CI;17.0-41.3]% and didn't met pre-planned boundary. Response rate was 27.9%. Tendency of prolonged survival was observed in patients with two or more family histories of P/B/O/PR cancer (HR 0.65, 95%CI [0.34- 1.23]). Family history or personal history with B/O/PR cancer tended to be associate with better response and prolonged survival. In this study, patient with family history of pancreatic cancer seemed to be associate with poor response. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (27%), thrombocytopenia (23%) and elevated level of ALT (20%). Treatment related death was not observed. Conclusion(s): GEMOX did not show expected efficacy in patients with metastatic PA with family history or personal history of P/B/O/PR cancer.

N2  -  Background: Cancer diagnosis increases with age, which is also a risk factor for the development of multiple malignant neoplasms. Patients with a primary tumor are at an 8,5% risk of developing secondary tumors. The incidence of primary neoplasms varies between 2,4% and 8%; 26% of the secondary presentations are synchronous and 74% are metachronous. We describe the case of a patient with multiple primary adenocarcinomas who develops pulmonary nodules, requiring further evaluation. Method(s): Review of clinical history Results: A 76 year old female with previous history of diabetes mellitus II and hypothyroidism presents with multiple primary adenocarcinomas including a well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas with extensive vascular and perineural compromise, stage T2N0M0, managed with a distal pancreaticoduodenectomy, splenectomy and radical lymphadenectomy; an apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, stage T3N0M0 with negative hormone receptors, managed with a mastectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy; a multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma, stage T1AN0M0, compromising the left vocal cord, managed with total thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine therapy and lymphadenectomy; and a gastrointestinal stromal spindle cell lesion, without necrosis but positive CD117, CD34, actin and desmin. A multi-gene panel test is performed for hereditary cancer syndromes (MyRISK) with complete sequencing and MLPA for BRCA1, BRCA2 with a negative result; and later MLPA and sequencing for APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRIP1, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHECK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PATEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11 and TP53 showing variants of uncertainsignificance and MLH1 polymorphism. Due to the positivity of serum cancer antigen 19-9, a PET-CT scan is performed identifying hypermetabolic nodules in the lingula and the left lower lobe. The patient is taken to lobectomy and wedge resection; pathology report is notable for a metastatic adenocarcinoma originated in the pancreas. NAB-Paclitaxel is initiated with complete remission. Conclusion(s): In this case the patient had breast, pancreatic, thyroid and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, with metastatic lesions in the lung of pancreatic origin. In the literature similar reports have not been described; however hormone associated carcinomas such as simultaneous ovarian, breast, uterine and thyroid malignancies have been reported before. Cases of primary lung adenocarcinoma associated with colorectal(22%), breast(18,4%), and gastric(14,4%) neoplasms have also been illustrated. Hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome,Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasiamust be studied in this patient. Here, the available genetic tests were inconclusive and the case requires further evaluation. Keywords: Pulmonary Metastasis, Multiple Primary AdenocarcinomasCopyright © 2019

N2  -  Objective: Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer in the United States with 14,000 deaths annually. Current standard of care for platinum-resistant disease includes single-agent liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, or the combination of paclitaxel with bevacizumab. These treatments are associated with a PFS of less than 6 months. Our objective was to evaluate the activity of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant or refractory ovarian cancer, as well as evaluate safety and side effect profile. Method(s): This was a retrospective review of patients with ovarian cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic in Florida from 2012 to 2018 treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel was given at 800 mg/M2 IV and 80 mg/M2 IV, respectively, on days 1, 8, 15, and every 28 days. A total of 22 patients were identified. and their records were reviewed; 17 patients were platinum-resistant and 5 patients were platinum-sensitive. Result(s): Seven out of 22 patients responded (overall response rates 31.8%). Overall response rate was 29.4% for platinum-resistant (5/17) compared to 40% for platinum-sensitive (2/5). PFS was 12.26 months for the whole group and 13.3 months for the platinum-resistant subset. No grade 3-5 nonhematologic toxicity was observed. This was a heavily pretreated group of patients with a median number of 2 previous treatments (range 1- 6 previous treatments). OS at 24 months was 36% with a 50% overall survival at 12 months. See Figure 1. Conclusion(s): The combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is a safe and effective treatment for relapsed platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer with superior results compared to historical control (PFS = 13.3 months compared to less than 6 months). This well-tolerated combination is a reasonable treatment option for these patients. [Figure presented]Copyright © 2019

N2  -  Background: Cutaneous metastases are common in non-skin cancers, resulting in considerable morbidity, infection, pain, and negatively impacting quality of life. No standard of care exists for effective control of cutaneous metastases, which is a significant unmet need in oncology. Paclitaxel has shown effectiveness in the treatment of ovarian, breast, non-small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the systemic treatment of many types of malignancies. We hypothesize that SOR007, or nanoparticulate paclitaxel ointment may be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of cutaneous metastases. Trial Design: This trial is a Phase 1/2, open-label study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of three concentrations of SOR007 (0.15%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) ointment applied topically, twice daily, to non-melanoma cutaneous metastases during a 3+3 dose-ascending or dose expansion phase. Subjects will self-apply SOR007 ointment twice daily on Days 1 to 28, to a 50 cm2 area containing an eligible lesion. If a single dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is identified in the three subjects, an additional three subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level. If one or more DLT occur in the three additional subjects, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be determined as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and taken forward into the dose expansion phase. If no further DLT are identified, dose escalation will continue, until either a DLT is identified at a higher dose or the top dose of 2% is reached. Once DLT is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase, to total up to 12 subjects at the top dose. Specific Aims: 1) The primary objective of this study is to determine preliminary safety and tolerability of topical SOR007. Secondary endpoints include: 2) evaluating preliminary efficacy based on RECIST criteria, photograph documentation of lesion size in longest diameter, and objective clinical response. 3) We will evaluate potential reduction in pain at the treatment area. 4) We will determine the peripheral blood pharmacokinetics of topical SOR007 applied to cutaneous metastases. Eligibility criteria: Male and female patients over the age of 18 with malignancies resulting in cutaneous metastasis originating from: breast, lung, head and neck, pancreatic, urinary bladder, prostate, testicular, ovarian, uterine, cervical, gastric, adrenal, thyroid, parathyroid cancers or other solid tumors which previously responded to taxane treatment are eligible to participate. Patients' last dose of any systemic non-taxane cytotoxic chemotherapy should be completed at least one day prior to the trial. Patients' last dose of any systemic taxane cytotoxic chemotherapy should be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the trial. Patients should be ECOG 0-2 with a minimum life expectancy of at least 3 months. Open or ulcerated wound(s) extending through the dermis are not eligible. Statistical methods: Data will be analyzed by descriptive statistics. Present accrual and target accrual: To date, we have enrolled 3 of a maximum of 24 subjects.

N2  -  Background. We recently described six distinct genomic configurations characterized by large numbers of distributed somatic tandem duplications (TDs) known as Tandem Duplicator Phenotypes (TDPs). Different TDPs feature TDs of different span sizes, and are enriched in TNBC, ovarian, and uterine cancers. Type 1 TDPs (i.e. groups 1, 1/2mix and 1/3mix) feature short span TDs (11Kb in size), invariably show abrogation of BRCA1 (via mutation or methylation) and of TP53, and affect 40% of TNBCs. We had observed, in limited in vitro and preclinical PDX models, that TDP status correlates with platinum sensitivity (1). Here, we assess TDP status across a cohort of 42 TNBC patients (pts) undergoing neoadjuvant carboplatin and NAB-paclitaxel to test the hypothesis that type 1 TDP status may be predictive of optimal response to platinum-based therapy. Methods. 42 pts with TNBC were enrolled in a phase II study of neoadjuvant carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel at the City of Hope National Medical Center (NCT01525966).Pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 50% of pts (21/42). WGS was performed using standard Illumina protocols. Structural variants were called using Crest, Delly and BreakDancer, and high confidence breakpoints were selected when called by at least two tools and by requiring split-read support. TDP status was ascertained as recently described (2). BRCA1 methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR. Results. 45% of the tumors classified as TDP (19/42). Consistent with our previous observation, the vast majority were type 1 TDPs with short span TDs (n=17) and were strongly associated with BRCA1 mutation or methylation (16/17, P= 1.4E-8). However, there was no correlation between TDP status and pCR (OR=1.1, NS). In a more detailed analysis, we found that BRCA1 mutation correlated with pCR rate (6/7 pCR, P=0.01), whereas promoter methylation did not (4/11 pCR, NS). Moreover, both pts with mutant BRCA2 achieved pCR. Thus, as a group, pts with BRCA1/2 mutations (but not BRCA1 methylation) were more likely to achieve pCR than those with wild type BRCA1/2 (OR=11.9, P=1.7E-2). Results were unchanged when using RCB 0 and 1 vs. RCB 2 and 3 as the response criteria. Conclusions. This study confirmed that reduction of BRCA1 activity via either mutation or methylation robustly associates with type 1 TDPs in TNBC. However, TDP status did not predict good response, suggesting the separation of BRCA effects on genomic instability and platinum sensitivity. This indicates that genomic signature assessments, such as TDP and HRD, may not be sufficient in predicting pCR in TNBC. Importantly, we found that BRCA1/2 mutated TNBC pts were more likely to experience pCR (8/9) compared with pts with either BRCA1 methylation (4/11) or wild type BRCA1/2 (8/21). The exact genetic underpinnings of response in non-BRCA pts are currently under investigation. References.

N2  -  Introduction: Ovarian cancer is usually detected by peritoneal carcinomatosis with ascites. Objective(s): We report on a 48-year old, postmenopausal woman initially presented to our clinic with an increasing abdominal girth and loss of appetite. Method(s): Previously the patient received a total laparoscopic hysterectomy because of fibroids. Radiological examination by external computer tomography showed malignant pleural effusion, urine stasis of the left kidney, peritoneal carcinomatosis with ascites and enlarged ovaries. Clinical examinations and also laboratory test results first thought of ovarian cancer of the left ovary as suspected diagnosis. In addition to that a suspicious area was found in the left breast. In order to determine the findings in the breast we first collected histological samples by punch biopsy resulting an invasive, hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (NST), G1. We performed laparoscopic surgery noticing an inoperable situs with extended peritoneal carcinomatosis in all four quadrants with an amount of 5 l of ascites and involvement of the bowel, especially the sigma. The appearance of the cancer was not typical for an ovarian cancer: missing affection of the pouch of Douglas, only superficial affected ovaries and the distribution patter of the intraabdominal spread of cancer. The noticed urine stasis of the left kidney was treated by implanting a double rail (7 Charr.). The histological results showed the peritoneal carcinomatosis being a visceral metastasis of the low grade breast cancer, however in this case hormone-receptor and Her2-positive. Our interdisciplinary case discussion proposed a palliative chemotherapy with nab-Paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 BSA d1 d8 q4w) to be the best treatment plan which was started 3 weeks after surgery. Discussion and conclusions: The diagnostic clarification of ovarian cancer should also consider other malignant primaries such as gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer or infectious diseases, e.g. tuberculosis, or liver diseases. In this case a low grade non-special type breast cancer has spread to distant organs, predominantly the peritoneum.Copyright © 2018

N2  -  Background: CA-125, a tumor marker expressed in > 50% pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC), was targeted with oregovomab (O), a monoclonal antibody currently in development as chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) for ovarian cancer. The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety, activity, & induction of cellular immune response of neoadjuvant & adjuvant CIT & stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) with nelfinavir (NFV) in patients with locally advanced PAC. Method(s): CIT consisted of 7 3-week cycles of gemcitabine (GEM) 750 mg/m2 (females) or 900 mg/m2 (males), leucovorin (LV) 50 mg/m2, Fluorouracil (FU) 2700 mg/m2/24 h on days 1 & 8, & O (2 mg) on day 15 (If CA125 >= 10). SBRT 40 Gy in 5 fractions with NFV (1250 mg BID) was given after 3 cycles of CIT. Surgery was performed after 4 cycles of CIT for resectable disease. Three more cycles of CIT were given adjuvantly or post-SBRT for unresectable disease. Result(s): The trial was closed prematurely due to the replacement of GEM/LV/FU by FOLFIRINOX & GEM/abraxane as standard of care for PAC. Eleven patients (2 females) were enrolled; 9/11 had O (1 had CA125 < 10, 1 died unexpectedly on day 2 of study); 10 got SBRT; 4 had a resection; 5 had 7 cycles of CIT (4 neoadjuvant & 3 adjuvant); 6/11 had >= grade 3 drug-related adverse events (AEs) using CTCAE v3. The most common AEs were marrow toxicity (low ANC 91%, low WBC 82%, low lymphocyte 45%, low platelet 36%, anemia 27%), liver function abnormalities (27%) and acidosis (18%). Median follow up was 17 months (M); 7 had disease progression (liver, 5, peritoneum, 1, retroperitoneal, 1); median time to progression 6.9 M (4-12); median survival 13 M (7-31); & 2 year survival 28%. Among those who got 7 cycles of CIT & SBRT, 2 developed CA125-specific interferon-gamma+ CD8 T cells, as detected by enzyme-linked immunoSpot, and survived 28+ & 31M. Conclusion(s): Antibodybased targeting of patient-specific CA125 in the context of CIT induced specific CD8 T-cell (Interferon-?+) immunity in select PAC patients. CIT SBRT is a feasible approach to induce immune responses to patient specific neo-antigen; however, activity should be reassessed using current frontline chemotherapy regimens.

N2  -  Poor loading capacity and nonspecific tumor accumulation of current drug delivery system remain the critical challenges that prevent nanomedicine from maximizing therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment. Herein, poly(ester amide) polymers composed of cationic and hydrophobic segments were formulated with a paclitaxel/human serum albumin (PTX/HSA) complex, as well as free PTX, to construct a core-shell nanoparticle (NP) platform with the interior simultaneously reserving PTX and PTX/HSA complex, while the exterior absorbing the PTX/HSA complex. Following systematic screening, the optimized NPs, namely, APP1i@e NPs, exhibited small particle size (43.95 nm), maximal PTX loading (42.23%), excellent dynamic stability (at least 1 week), and acid-triggered release. In vitro results showed that after being trafficked through caveolae-mediated endocytosis, APP1i@e NPs successfully escaped from endo-/lysosomes and then rapidly released cargos in the acidic cytosol, which continued to enhance cytotoxicity by mitochondrial control of apoptosis and suppression of microtubule dynamics. Longer circulation time and superior targeting efficiency post-intravenous injection confirmed that surface PEGylation imparted APP1i@e NPs with the ability to control their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The biomimetic shell design with HSA, which enlarged PTX stock and improved biosafety, made APP1i@e NPs more suitable for in vivo applications. Furthermore, in vivo safety and efficacy demonstrated that APP1i@e NPs effectively inhibited the growth of ovarian xenograft tumors, whereas significantly avoiding toxic issues associated with PTX. APP1i@e NPs with surface PEG coating and biomimetic HSA design, therefore, may provide a remarkable improvement in the therapeutic index of taxanes used in the clinic.

N2  -  Background: Nanoparticles hold considerable promise for aerosol-based intraperitoneal delivery in patients with carcinomatosis. Recently, results from preclinical and early clinical trials suggested that albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP, AbraxaneTM) may result in superior efficacy in the treatment of peritoneal metastases (PM) compared to the standard solvent-based paclitaxel formulation (TaxolTM). Here, we propose a phase I study of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) using ABP in patients with upper Gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer. Method(s): Eligible patients with advanced, biopsy-proven PM from ovarian, breast, gastric, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic origin will undergo three PIPAC treatments using ABP with a 4-week interval. The dose of ABP will be escalated from 35 to 140mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the maximally tolerated dose is determined. The primary end point is dose-limiting toxicity. Secondary analyses include surgical morbidity, non-access rate, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, quality of life, and exploratory circulating biomarker analyses. Discussion(s): ABP holds considerable promise for intraperitoneal aerosol delivery. The aim of this study is to determine the dose level for future randomized phase II trials using ABP in PIPAC therapy.Copyright © 2018 Van De Sande et al, published by De Gruyter.

N2  -  Background: We performed a phase I modified 3 + 3 dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and activity of bevacizumab plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumours. Method(s): Patients were given fixed dose gemcitabine plus increasing doses of nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab. Toxicity, response, and association with VEGF polymorphism was analysed. Result(s): The study enrolled 110 patients who had undergone a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. The median age was 60 years (range, 17-85 years), and 55 patients (50%) had gemcitabine-refractory disease. We observed 3 dose-limiting toxicities during dose escalation and 3 DLTs in expansion cohorts. Dose escalation to 150 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel and 15 mg/kg bevacizumab with 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine was well tolerated with no MTD. One patient with gemcitabine-refractory peritoneal papillary carcinoma had a complete response, 13 patients (13%) had partial responses, and 54 patients (52%) had stable disease >=12 weeks. Exploratory VEGF single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed on 13 patients. Conclusion(s): The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, and bevacizumab is safe, well-tolerated, and has activity in advanced malignancies, including gemcitabine-refractory tumours. Based on this study, the recommended phase 2 dose is gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2, and bevacizumab 15 mg/kg. VEGF polymorphism data should be evaluated in future bevacizumab-based trials.Copyright © 2018 Cancer Research UK.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is an anticancer agent efficacious in the treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancer. Due to a strong link between the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel, we reviewed the literature on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Systematic data mining was performed to extract the maximum concentration (Cmax), clearance (CL), and time of paclitaxel plasma concentration above 0.05 micromol/L (T > 0.05 micromol/L) following monotherapy of both the widely used cremophor-diluted paclitaxel and nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab-)paclitaxel. We identified a total of 53 studies yielding 121 aggregated pharmacokinetic profiles for paclitaxel monotherapy and extracted reported mean and median estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. Paclitaxel has been studied formally at doses of 15-825 mg/m2 and infused over 0.5-96 h; included studies examined both weekly and every 3-weeks dosing cycles. The most widely used dose of cremophor-diluted paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-h infusion, leads to an interstudy median Cmax of 5.1 micromol/L [interquartile range (IQR) 4.5-5.7], CL of 12.0 L/h/m2 (IQR 10.9-12.9), and T > 0.05 micromol/L of 23.8 h (IQR 21.5-26.8). Importantly, the significant interindividual variation widely reported in the literature is not reflected in these interstudy estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. Cremophor-diluted paclitaxel pharmacokinetics are non-linear following short (<6 h) but not long (>24 h) infusions. A similar pattern of non-linearity was observed for nab-paclitaxel, although the number of studies was limited. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel monotherapy have been widely studied at numerous dose levels of the Cremophor EL formulation, but are less well-characterized for the newer nab-paclitaxel formulation. In conclusion, paclitaxel pharmacokinetics are non-linear for short infusion times but not for longer infusions. Whether a similar conclusion can be drawn for nab-paclitaxel formulations requires further study.Copyright © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

N2  -  The major cause of ovarian cancer treatment failure in cancer patients is inherent or acquired during treatment drug resistance of cancer. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a secreted, non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein involved in inhibition of tissue calcification. Recently, MGP expression was related to cellular differentiation and tumor progression. A detailed MGP expression analysis in sensitive (A2780) and resistant to paclitaxel (PAC) (A2780PR) and topotecan (TOP) (A2780TR) ovarian cancer cell lines and their corresponding media was performed. MGP mRNA level (real time PCR analysis) and protein expression in cell lysates and cell culture medium (Western blot analysis) and protein expression in cancer cells (immunofluorescence analysis) and cancer patient lesions (immunohistochemistry) were determined in this study. We observed increased expression of MGP in PAC and TOP resistant cell lines at both mRNA and protein level. MGP protein was also detected in the corresponding culture media. Finally, we detected expression of MGP protein in ovarian cancer lesions from different histological type of cancer. MGP is an important factor that might contribute to cancer resistance mechanism by augmenting the interaction of cells with ECM components leading to increased resistance of ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel and topotecan. Expression found in ovarian cancer tissue suggests its possible role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

N2  -  Objective: Paclitaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, is subject to tumor resistance while treating high-grade serous ovarian and uterine cancer. This study aims to directly compare the effects of SQ1274, a novel microtubule inhibitor that binds to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin, and paclitaxel in high-grade serous ovarian and uterine cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Method(s): We assessed the sensitivity of ovarian (OVCAR8) and uterine (ARK1) cancer cell lines to SQ1274 and paclitaxel using XTT assays. We used western blot and quantitative real-time PCR to analyze changes in AXL RNA and protein expression by SQ1274 and paclitaxel. Differences in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Finally, we treated ovarian and uterine xenograft models with vehicle, paclitaxel, or SQ1274. Result(s): First, we demonstrate that SQ1274 has a much lower IC50 than paclitaxel in both ARK1 (1.26 nM vs. 15.34 nM, respectively) and OVCAR8 (1.34 nM vs. 10.29 nM, respectively) cancer cell lines. Second, we show SQ1274 decreases both RNA and protein expression of AXL. Third, we show that SQ1274 causes increased cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis compared to paclitaxel. Finally, we report that SQ1274 more effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo compared to paclitaxel. Conclusion(s): SQ1274 presents as a viable alternative to paclitaxel for treating ovarian and uterine cancer. This study supports the development of SQ1274 as a chemotherapeutic to treat ovarian and uterine cancer.Copyright © 2018

N2  -  Abstract. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of mesenchymal cells in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. They are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemotherapy resistance by directly contacting with cancer cells or secretory cytokines. In the present study, we examined the role of CAFs in the induction of EMT in ovarian cancer. Primary ovarian cancer cells, CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from fresh cancer tissue and cultured for immunohistochemistry studies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression of IL-6 in the culture supernatants of these cells. The expression of IL-6 at the mRNA level was examined by RT-PCR. The expression of IL-6 at the protein level in ovarian cancer tissues was determined using an immunofluorescence assay in both tissue sections and cell lobes. OVCAR3 cells were treated with the culture supernatants collected from CAFs and NFs. IL-6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was employed to neutralize IL-6. The expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was assessed. Changes in EMT, proliferation, invasion and proapoptotic protein expression were also examined. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the changes in apoptosis resistance of OVCAR3 cells. The JAK2/STAT3 pathway-specific inhibitor AG490 was used to block this pathway and the beta-TGF inhibitor was used to inhibit EMT. The clinical data of patients treated in our hospital were collected between January 1st, 2009 and June 30th, 2013. The expression of interstitial IL-6 in paraffin-embedded tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the expression of interstitial IL-6 and the treatment response was examined by linear regression and multiple linear regression analyses. We found that CAFs were the main source of IL-6 in ovarian cancer tissue. CAFs promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 in ovarian cancer and enhanced the proliferation, invasion and EMT. Enhanced EMT may lead to apoptosis resistance, inhibitory expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and paclitaxel resistance. A total of 255 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that age, CA125, interstitial IL-6 expression and cytoreduction satisfaction were closely related to the sensitivity of the TP (docetaxel plus cisplatin or carbopatin) regimen in ovarian cancer (P<0.05). These results demonstrated that CAFs highly secreted IL-6 and promoted beta-TGF-mediated EMT in ovarian cancer via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, leading to inhibited apoptosis and subsequent paclitaxel resistance. Therefore, CAFs may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2018 Spandidos Publications. All Rights Reserved.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) encapsulated in albumin (Abraxane) is an FDA approved frontline nano-formulation for treating advance metastatic pancreatic, lung and breast cancers. Currently in clinic, Abraxane is being used as a one of the components of combination therapy regimens. On the other hand, difluorinated curcumin (CDF) is a novel and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is being evaluated for several malignancies including pancreatic, liver, ovarian and breast cancers. To improve the bioavailability and targeting ability of hydrophobic PTX and CDF, we have encapsulated them in folic acid decorated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles, namely FA-BSA-PTX and FA-BSA-CDF, respectively. Both the formulations yielded uniform nano-sized particles with smooth surface morphology, negative surface potential and high drug loading efficiency. Due to heterogeneity and complexity of several cancers, combination regimens are becoming standard arsenals against several deadly cancers. To evaluate the synergistic anti-cancer effect of PTX and CDF, we assessed the combination therapy using intravenously administrable folate decorated albumin bio-conjugate nanoparticles against folate overexpressing ovarian and cervical cancers. Our results demonstrate that combination of FA-BSA-CDF with FA-BSA-PTX produced synergistic anticancer effect, augmented due to folate receptor mediated targeted uptake as well as induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, our preliminary studies show a promising nanomedicine platform for combination therapy for leading gynecological tumor, such as ovarian and cervical cancer.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) belongs to a class of taxane anti-tumor drug used for the clinic treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and so on. PTX has poor water solubility and oral bioavailability. It is generally administered via intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Traditional PTX injectable preparations contain Cremophor-EL and ethanol to improve its solubility, which would result in adverse reactions like severe hypersensitivity, neutropenia, etc. Adverse reactions can be reduced only by complicated pretreatment with glucocorticoid and antihistamines drugs and followed by PTX slow infusion for three hours, which has brought significant inconvenience to the patients. Though, a new-generation PTX formulation, Abraxane, free of Cremophor-EL and ethanol, is still being administrated by frequent i.v. infusions and extremely expensive. Therefore, non-injection administration of PTX is urgently needed to avoid the side effects as well as reduce inconvenience to the patients. Recently, a variety of non-injection drug delivery systems (DDSs) of PTX have been developed. This review aims to discuss the progress of non-injectable administration systems of PTX, including oral administration systems, vaginal administration systems, implantable DDSs, transdermal DDSs and intranasal administration for the future study and clinical applications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Therapeutic effects of anti-cancer drugs for ovarian cancer were limited due to the rapid development of chemotherapy resistance. The aim of this study was to test whether knockdown of Homeobox B4 (HOXB4) enhanced the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells. HOXB4 expressions at mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in Taxol-resistant A2780 (A2780/Taxol) and DDP-resistant SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/DDP) cells. HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells, respectively. HOXB4 silencing suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and reduced the expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or siRNA targeting Akt (si-Akt) treatment inhibited cell viability, decreased protein levels of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2, and increased LDH release in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells. These findings revealed that HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP by downregulating ABC transporters via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian cancer cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Chemotherapy is an important adjuvant therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The main cause of chemotherapy failure in EOC is paclitaxel resistance. The present study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to predict chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance in EOC. In the present study, the heterogeneity of EOC was evaluated by adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) in vitro. Fresh samples were collected from 54 EOC cases during cytoreductive surgery. Tumor cells were isolated, cultured, and tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel. Proteins that were differentially expressed between paclitaxel-resistant tissues and paclitaxel-sensitive tissues were identified via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis. Two upregulated proteins, plexin domain containing 2 (Plxdc2) and cytokeratin 7 (CK7), were selected to verify the iTRAQ method using western blot analysis in EOC tissues with different chemosensitivities (sensitive, weakly sensitive and resistant). There was notable heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in the EOC specimens. Highly to mildly-differentiated or early-stage (I/II) EOC specimens had decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel compared with specimens with low differentiation (P<0.05) or an advanced stage (III; P<0.05), respectively. A total of 496 significantly differentially expressed proteins, including 263 that were downregulated (P<0.05) and 233 that were upregulated (P<0.05) in paclitaxel-resistant tissues compared with paclitaxel-sensitive tissues, were identified using iTRAQ in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression levels of two proteins associated with paclitaxel resistance, Plxdc2 and CK7, were further validated by western blotting, which revealed that they were upregulated in the paclitaxel-resistant tissues. The present study determined candidate proteins associated with paclitaxel resistance in EOC. Plxdc2 and CK7 may be potential makers for distinguishing patients with paclitaxel-resistant EOC from those with paclitaxel-sensitive EOC.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

N2  -  Here we report a case of pancreatic cancer (PC) with peritoneal dissemination, underwent conversion surgery following chemotherapy for 2 years. A 55-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of PC. Abdominal CT scan revealed 3.0 cm of a pancreatic head tumor with abutment of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, classified as borderline resectable. Staging laparoscopy (SL) showed positive peritoneal cytology (CY).Gemcitabine (Gem) plus S-1 therapy (GS) was performed. Ten months after initial GS, SL revealed the disseminated nodule and positive CY. The regimen was changed to Gem plus nab-paclitaxel therapy (Gem plus nab-PTX). Since right ovarian tumor was detected by CT scan 6 months after initial Gem plus nab-PTX, laparoscopic oophorectomy was performed. Histological findings showed positive CY and ovarian metastasis of PC. Afterward, Gem plus nab-PTX has been continued for 8 months. Since SL after 2 years from initial chemotherapy showed negative CY and no metastatic lesion, pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection was performed as conversion surgery. According to General Rules for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer the 7th edition by Japan Pancreas Society, histological findings showed ypT3, ypNO, R0, and Grade 1b of histological effect. The patient is alive without recurrence 6 months after the resection.Copyright © 2018 Japanese Journal of Cancer and Chemotherapy Publishers Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  We report here that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and ABCB1 are upregulated in SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells that acquired resistance to the anticancer drug taxol. Silencing of TLR4 using short-hairpin RNA sensitized taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells to taxol (4.6 fold), whereas ectopic expression of TLR4 in parental, taxol-sensitive SKOV3 cells or TLR4-null HEK293 cells induced taxol resistance (~2 fold). A sub-lethal dose of taxol induced ABCB1 protein expression in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. Inactivation of TLR4 using chemical inhibitors (CLI-095 and AO-I) downregulated ABCB1 protein expression and enhanced the cytotoxic activity of taxol in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. While the sensitization effect of TLR4 inactivation was also detected in TOV21G ovarian cancer cells, which express moderate level of TLR4, ectopic expression of ABCB1 prevented the sensitization effect in these cells. Notably, the NFkappaB pathway was significantly activated by taxol, and inhibition of this pathway suppressed TLR4-regulated ABCB1 expression. Furthermore, taxol-induced NFkappaB signaling was reduced following TLR4 silencing in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. Consistent with these results, ectopic expression of TLR4 in taxol-sensitive SKOV3 cells enhanced ABCB1 expression and conferred resistance to taxol. The protective effect of exogenous TLR4 expression against taxol was reduced by treatment with NFkappaB inhibitor in these cells. These results demonstrate that taxol activates the TLR4-NFkappaB pathway which in turn induces ABCB1 gene expression. This cellular pathway thus represents a novel target to limit resistance to taxol in ovarian cancer cells.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Purpose/Objective(s): Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a non-invasive, loco-regional, antimitotic treatment modality, approved for glioblastoma. TTFields are delivered to the tumor through transducer arrays applied non-invasively to the tumor region. In a phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), TTFields added to temozolomide was not associated with any significant increase in systemic adverse events (AEs) versus temozolomide alone. The only treatment-related AE seen in TTFields-treated patients was localized dermatitis underneath the arrays. Mild-moderate dermatitis was reported in 52% of patients (2% had grade 3 skin toxicity). The safety of TTFields was investigated in four phase I-II studies in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Materials/Methods: TTFields studies included in analysis: EF-15 (n=41, advanced NSCLC; plus pemetrexed), PANOVA (n=40, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma; plus gemcitabine with or without nab-paclitaxel), STELLAR (n=64, malignant pleural mesothelioma; plus platinum and pemetrexed) and INNOVATE (n=31, recurrent ovarian carcinoma; combined with weekly paclitaxel). TTFields were applied 12 - 18 hours/day at frequency of 150-200 kHz per tumor histology. All patients received standard of care systemic chemotherapy for their disease in addition to TTFields. Severity and frequency of AEs, and association with TTFields treatment were evaluated (CTCAE criteria). Result(s): The median age of patients was 69 (range: 41-81), 73 (49-81), 68 (43-78) and 60 (45-77) for EF-15, PANOVA, STELLAR, and INNOVATE, respectively. Patients had an ECOG score of 0-1; 7 patients in the EF-15 study had ECOG 2. The incidence of grade 1-2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities was >=5%: constipation (16%), diarrhea (14%), nausea (27%) and vomiting (13%). Grade 1-2 general disorders such as asthenia, fatigue and anorexia were common (<20%). Grade 3-4 dyspnea (6%) was reported in patients with lung tumors. These AEs were related to standard chemotherapy or underlying disease. The incidence of arrhythmias was <=2% and none were severe. The only common TTFields-related adverse event was dermatitis beneath the transducer arrays. 50% patients had dermatological AEs: Grade 1-2 dermatitis in 50% of and grade 3 dermatitis in 6% of patients. 7% of patients complained of grade 1-2 pruritus. Dermatologic AEs were managed using published guidelines leading to full resolution in all cases. Conclusion(s): Treatment of solid tumors with TTFields at 150-200 kHz to the lungs, abdomen and upper pelvis did not result in serious AEs or treatment related pulmonary, cardiac, hematological or gastrointestinal toxicity. Expected dermatological toxicity beneath the device transducer arrays was seen in 50% patients, and resolved after treatment termination.Copyright © 2018

N2  -  Introduction Microtubule Interfering Agents (MIA's), such as Taxol (Paclitaxel) are used in the treatment of cancers such as breast, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancer. MIA's arrest cells in mitosis by activating the mitotic checkpoint. Prolonged mitotic arrest results in apoptotic cell death although the precise mechanism of Taxol-induced cell death is unclear. Previous studies have shown that Taxol activates the proapoptotic effector proteins, Bak and Bax, which accumulate at the mitochondrial outer membrane. At the mitochondrion Bax and Bak are thought to oligomerize and/or interact with the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP) to increase the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane which then leads to cytochrome c release and apoptosis. In this study we have examined the requirement for Bax and Bak in Taxol-induced apoptosis and their possible interaction with components of the MPTP. Material and methods Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were treated with either Bax, Bak or both Bax and Bak siRNA, synchronised and treated with Taxol (60 nM) for varying times (0-24 hour). Apoptosis was assessed using either cytokeratin 18 cleavage (M30 antibody), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage or activation of pro-caspases (3 and 9). Bak and Bax were immunoprecipitated using antiactive Bak (N-20) and anti-active Bax (6A7) antibodies in CHAPS lysis buffer. To identify interacting proteins, Bak and Bax IPs were subjected to peptide mass fingerprint analysis by mass spectrometry. Confocal microscopy was used to examine the intracellular localization of Bax and Bak following Taxol treatment. Results and discussions The results of our siRNA studies indicate that although Bax and Bak can form homo-oligomers in the absence of each other, both proteins are required for Taxol-induced apoptosis. Our immunofluorescence study shows that Bak and Bax co-localise at mitochondria in the Taxolarrested cells. Our proteomic and co-IP analyses indicate that Bak and Bax form a complex specifically in the Taxol-arrested cells that also includes components of the MPTP such as the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT2) and Bcl-2. Conclusion We conclude that the oligomerisation of Bax and Bak is insufficient for Taxol-mediated apoptosis. However, the interaction of activated Bax and Bak with the MPTP appears to be necessary for Taxol-induced apoptosis.

N2  -  Introduction Chronic endometriosis is most commonly associated with clear cell neoplasms. Rarely, endometriosis can be complicated with endometrioid carcinoma. According to the literature, any abdominal structure can be involved. The vagina is rarely reported as the primary location of endometrioid adenocarcinoma associated with endometriosis with only six cases published in the last 20 years none of them with lymph node involvement. In this setting, staging and treatment references are missing. Here we present the diagnosis, surgical and adjuvant treatment of a patient with an endometrioid adenocarcinoma arising from endometriosis of the vaginal fornix with nodal involvement and extension to the Douglas pouch and rectal wall. Patients and methods A 56-year-old patient with a medical history of bilateral oophorectomy for endometriosis in 2002 was admitted to our gynecological department for investigation of progressive perineal pain with vaginal discharge developing over 5 months. Pelvic MRI and a PET-CT identified a mass of the posterior vaginal fornix infiltrating the Douglas pouch and possibly the rectal wall. There was no evidence of uterine involvement nor nodal or distant metastasis. Initial surgical debulking consisted in a laparoscopic posterior exenteration with bowel anastomosis and ileostomy, bilateral pelvic lymph-node dissection and vaginal reconstruction. The pathology report confirmed a grade1, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, measuring 30mm, with nodal involvement (1/25), infiltrating the perirectal fat but not the muscular layer, developed on an endometriosis lesion. There was no lymphovascular or perineural invasion and the surgical margins free of tumor. For this locally advanced ectopic endometrial adenocarcinoma, there is no specific staging system nor treatment guideline. The literature review for similar cases provids only scarce evidence, therefore we extended our research to endometrioid adenocarcinomas arising from endometriosis loci of other abdominal localization. Of the 13 published cases, three presented with nodal involvement and 8/13 had documented adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The median progression free survival (PFS) of the treated cases was 24months [0-60] and 10months among the three cases with nodal involvement [6-28]. Results Based on these findings, for this high risk of relapse setting, we decided a sequential adjuvant treatment with 4-6 cycles of carboplatinum AUC5-paclitaxel 175mg/m2 chemotherapy followed by EBRT and Brachytherapy. This approach was inspired by stage III endometrial carcinoma treatment. Because of a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction on cycle one, despite adequate premedication, the paclitaxel was changed for a weekly nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 treatment. The toxicities observed with the carboplatinum-nab-paclitaxel combination was manageable. After completing 4 cycles of chemotherapy, the patient received radiotherapy and is free from relapse one year after the completion of her adjuvant treatment. Conclusion Endometrial adenocarcinoma associated with endometriosis is a rare gynecological malignancy. The decision of a sequential chemoradiation treatment as indicated for classic uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma needs to be personalized. The substitution of the three-weekly schedule of chromophore diluted paclitaxel, with a weekly schedule of nab-paclitaxel is feasible and globally well tolerated but further study is necessary to determine the equivalence of this weekly, dose dense, approach in this setting.

N2  -  Background: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), a non-invasive, antimitotic treatment delivered through transducer arrays, is approved for glioblastoma. The phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma showed no significant increase in systemic adverse events (AEs) except for localized dermatitis underneath the arrays. The safety of TTFields was investigated in four phase I-II non-brain malignancies: non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Method(s): The TTFields phase I-II studies analyzed were: EF-15 (n=41, advanced NSCLC with pemetrexed), PANOVA (n=40, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with gemcitabine +/- nab-paclitaxel), STELLAR (n=64, MPM with platinum/ pemetrexed) and INNOVATE (n=31, recurrent ovarian carcinoma with weekly paclitaxel). TTFields were applied for 12-18 hours at 150-200 kHz per tumor histology. Patients received standard-of-care systemic chemotherapy for their disease. Severity and frequency of AEs and association with TTFields were evaluated (CTCAE V 4.0). Result(s): Patient median age was 69 years (range 41-81), 73 (49-81), 68 (43-78) and 60 (45-77) for EF-15, PANOVA, STELLAR and INNOVATE, respectively. Patients were ECOG status 0-1, except for 7 patients in EF-15 with ECOG 2. Observed toxicities were mostly related to underlying disease or standard chemotherapy. Grade 1-2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were: constipation (16%), diarrhea (14%), nausea (27%) and vomiting (13%). Grade 1-2 general disorders such as asthenia were common but less than 20%. Grade 3-4 dyspnea was observed in 6% of NSCLC patients. No clinically significant cardiac AEs were observed and mild arrhythmias were observed in less than 2% of patients. The common TTFields-related AE was dermatitis under the transducer arrays (50% Grade 1-2; 6% Grade 3 dermatitis and 7% Grades 1-2 pruritus). Dermatologic AEs managed using published guidelines were fully resolved. Conclusion(s): Treatment of solid tumors with TTFields (150-200 kHz) to the lungs, pleura, abdomen and upper pelvis did not result in treatment-related pulmonary, cardiac, hematological or gastrointestinal toxicity. Expected dermatological toxicity (50%) beneath the transducer arrays was easily managed. Keywords: TTFields; torso arrays; Safety meta-analysisCopyright © 2018

N2  -  Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) is a non-invasive, loco-regional, antimitotic treatment modality, approved for treatment of glioblastoma. TTFields are delivered to the tumor through transducer arrays applied non-invasively to the region of the body with the highest tumor burden. In a phase 3 trial in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), addition of TTFields to temozolomide was not associated with any significant increase in rates of systemic adverse events (AEs) versus temozolomide alone. The only common treatment related AE seen in TTFields-treated patients was localized dermatitis underneath the arrays. Mild-moderate dermatitis was reported in 52% of patients (2% had grade 3 skin toxicity). The safety of TTFields was investigated in four phase I-II studies for malignancies located outside of the brain: non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC), mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. Methods Four phase I-II clinical studies of TTFields were included in the analysis: EF-15 (n=41, advanced NSCLC; combined with pemetrexed), PANOVA (n=40, advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma; combined with gemcitabine with or without nabpaclitaxel), STELLAR (n=64, malignant pleural mesothelioma; combined with platinum and pemetrexed) and INNOVATE (n=31, recurrent ovarian carcinoma; combined with weekly paclitaxel). The frequency of TTFields applied was 150200 kHz depending on tumor histology. The compliance required per protocol with TTFields was 12 -18 hours/day. All patients received standard of care systemic chemotherapy for their disease in addition to TTFields. Severity and frequency of AEs, and association with the experimental treatment were evaluated using CTCAE criteria. Results The median age of patients was 69 (range: 41-81), 73 (49-81), 68 (43-78) and 60 (45-77) for EF-15, PANOVA, STELLAR and INNOVATE, respectively. Patients enrolled in the trials had an ECOG score of 01, except for 7 patients enrolled in the EF-15 study with ECOG score of 2. The incidence of grade 1-2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities was >=5%: constipation (16%), diarrhea (14%), nausea (27%) and vomiting (13%). GI toxicity was related to standard chemotherapy or underlying disease in all cases. Grade 1-2 general disorders such as asthenia, fatigue and anorexia were common but less than 20% for each, and were related to the underlying disease or standard chemotherapy. Grade 3-4 dyspnea (6%) was reported in patients with lung tumors, related to exacerbation of the underlying disease. The incidence of all types of arrhythmias was <=2% and none were severe. The only common TTFields related adverse event was dermatitis beneath the device transducer arrays. Half of the patients (50%) had grade 1-2 dermatitis, while grade 3 dermatitis was seen in 6% of patients. 7% of patients complained of grade 1-2 pruritus. Dermatologic AEs were managed using published guidelines leading to full resolution in all cases. Conclusions Treatment of solid tumor patients with TTFields at 150-200 kHz to the lungs, abdomen and upper pelvis did not result in treatment related pulmonary, cardiac, hematological or gastrointestinal toxicity. Expected dermatological toxicity beneath the device transducer arrays was seen in half of the patients, and resolved after treatment termination in all cases.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION Cancer diagnosis increases with age, which is also a risk factor for the development of multiple malignant neoplasms. Patients with a primary tumor are at an 8,5% risk of developing secondary tumors. The incidence of primary neoplasms varies between 2,4% and 8%; 26% of the secondary presentations are synchronous and 74% are metachronous. We describe the case of a patient with multiple primary adenocarcinomas who develops pulmonary nodules, requiring further evaluation. CASE REPORT A 76 year old female with previous history of diabetes mellitus II and hypothyroidism presents with multiple primary adenocarcinomas including a well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas with extensive vascular and perineural compromise, stage T2N0M0, managed with a distal pancreaticoduodenectomy, splenectomy and radical lymphadenectomy; an apocrine ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast, stage T3N0M0 with negative hormone receptors, managed with a mastectomy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy; a multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma, stage T1AN0M0, compromising the left vocal cord, managed with total thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine therapy and lymphadenectomy; and a gastrointestinal stromal spindle cell lesion, without necrosis but positive CD117, CD34, actin and desmin. A multi-gene panel test is performed for hereditary cancer syndromes (MyRISK) with complete sequencing and MLPA for BRCA1, BRCA2 with a negative result; and later MLPA and sequencing for APC, ATM, BARD1, BMPR1A, BRIP1, BRIP1, CDH1, CDK4, CDKN2A, CHECK2, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PATEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, SMAD4, STK11 and TP53 showing variants of uncertain significance and MLH1 polymorphism. Due to the positivity of serum cancer antigen 19-9, a PET-CT scan is performed identifying hypermetabolic nodules in the lingula and the left lower lobe. The patient is taken to lobectomy and wedge resection; pathology report is notable for a metastatic adenocarcinoma originated in the pancreas. NAB-Paclitaxel is initiated with complete remission. DISCUSION In this case the patient had breast, pancreatic, thyroid and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, with metastatic lesions in the lung of pancreatic origin. In the literature similar reports have not been described; however hormone associated carcinomas such as simultaneous ovarian, breast, uterine and thyroid malignancies have been reported before. Cases of primary lung adenocarcinoma associated with colorectal (22%), breast (18,4%), and gastric (14,4%) neoplasms have also been illustrated. Hereditary cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome and multiple endocrine neoplasia must be studied in this patient. Here, the available genetic tests were inconclusive and the case requires further evaluation.

N2  -  Dedifferentiated mucinous ovarian carcinoma is a rare type of carcinoma with few reports and progressive and poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the mutation about this ovarian carcinoma with the exome sequence and clarify the underlying mechanism of this carcinogenesis.We detected mutations in KRAS, p53 and other mutations with prognostic values and chemotherapy resistance. p53 mutation is a characteristic in the type 2 ovarian tumor, although mucinous ovarian tumor is type 1. In addition, we focused on the novel stop codon mutation in CEP170 (centrosomal protein 170) gene resulting ina paclitaxel resistance. CEP170 is the microtubule-binding protein that controls the targeting of the kinesin-13 depolymerase protein to the mitotic spindle, and kinesin-13 family was reported that mediates paclitaxel resistance. In conclusion, the carcinogenesis of mucinous carcinoma is different from another type 1 epithelial ovarian cancer. In addition, CEP170 is one of the influenced carcinogenesis. Now we are revealing of the mechanisms of dedifferentiated mucinous ovarian tumor, and are confirming CEP170 genes role in modulating chemotherapeutic sensitivity.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To research the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein gene (XIAP) on paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. METHOD(S): A2780 and A2780/T cells were treated with paclitaxel respectively at the concentrations of 5 ng/mL,10 ng/mL,20 ng/mL , 40 ng/mL,80 ng/mL,160 ng/mL,320 ng/mL,then the inhibition rate of cells were detected by MTT assay. The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein among the A2780 and A2780/T cells treated respectively with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL was detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. The A2780/T cells were divided into blank group,empty group,small interfering RNA (siRNA) XIAP group and siRNA-non-specific group. The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein of four groups were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Apoptotic rate of these groups with addition of paclitaxel at the concentrations of 0 ng/mL,1 000 ng/mL,1 500 ng/mL,2 000 ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL were detected by flow cytometry. RESULT(S): After the treatments on A2780 and A2780/T cells with the different concentrations of paclitaxel,the inhibition rate of A2780 cells were gradually increased with the increased paclitaxel concentrations (P<0.05),while there were no obvious differences in A2780/T cells (P>0.05). After the treatment on these cells with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL,the expression of XIAP mRNA was lower than that non-treatment with paclitaxelin A2780 cells (P<0.05),and the expression of XIAP mRNA in the A2780/T cells were no statistical significance between the treatment group and non-treatment group with paclitaxel (P>0.05). However,the expression of A2780/T cells'XIAP mRNA and protein treated with paclitaxel were higher than A2780 cells' (P<0.05). The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein in siRNA-XIAP group was lower than those of other groups (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of siRNA-XIAP group was higher than those of other groups treated with the paclitaxel at concentrations of 2 000 ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL (P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): XIAP's high expression on mRNA and protein was correlated with ovarian cancer paclitaxel-resistance,specific siRNA can promote cell apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP,and increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to paclitaxel.Copyright© by Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Science Edition).

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, when poorly responsive to standard treatment. First-line treatment consists in schemes including cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy schemes with platinum and taxane derivatives. Second-line regimens are based on gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin. Third line is often not worthwhile because of the high toxicity with poor response to treatment. Previously, we showed that paclitaxel (PTX) carried in non-protein lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) resembling the chemical structure of LDL has remarkably reduced toxicity. Here, the hypothesis was tested whether PTX-LDE could safely benefit patients in third-line treatment setting. Fourteen women unresponsive to second-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, aged 61 +/- 10 years, clinical stage IV and TqNqM1, were included. PTX-LDE was administered at 175 mg/m2, 3/3 week dose. Patients were submitted to clinical examinations before each chemotherapy cycle. Serum biochemistry and imaging examinations to monitor disease progression were performed. In total, 74 cycles of chemotherapy were done and, in all cycles, clinical or laboratorial toxicities were not observed. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.0-3.9). In four patients, PFS was >6 months and in 2 > 1 year. The unpreceded, striking absence of toxicity and consistently long PFS, compared to previous results, indicate that at least 4 among 14 patients had tumor arrest by the treatment and clear benefit of PTX-LDE at third-line setting. The absence of observable toxicity allows dose escalating to improve response to treatment, as perspective to be tested in the ensuing studies.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic malignant tumors. The major obstacle to treatment success is multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy drugs. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloidderived compound, has shown MDR reversal potency in several tumor cell lines; however, the molecular mechanism is not entirely known. In the present study, we assessed whether CH sensitized malignant cells to chemotherapy drugs in ovarian cancer and explored the relevant mechanism. We found that CH reduced the IC50 value of paclitaxel and increased intracellular rhodamine-123 accumulation in human ovarian cancer A2780/Taxol cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay demonstrated that CH inhibited MDR1 expression as indicated by reduced mRNA and protein levels in A2780/ Taxol cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect was strengthened after CH was combined with the specific PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, p-Akt expression decreased gradually with the concentration of CH (2, 4 and 8 muM). Taken together, these findings indicated that CH reversed P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR in A2780/Taxol cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

N2  -  Objective: To report on the incidence of nab-paclitaxel hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in patients with prior taxane HSR. Method(s): From 2005 to 2015, all patients who received nab-paclitaxel for a gynecologic malignancy were identified. Chart abstraction included pathology, prior therapy, indication for nab-paclitaxel, dosing, response, toxicities including any HSR, and reason for discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel therapy. Result(s): We identified 37 patients with gynecologic malignancies with a history of paclitaxel HSR who received nab-paclitaxel. Six patients (16.2%) had a prior HSR to both paclitaxel and docetaxel while the other 31 patients had not received docetaxel. No patients experienced a HSR to nab-paclitaxel. Median number of cycles of nab-paclitaxel was 6 (range 2-20). Twelve patients received weekly dosing at 60 to 100 mg/m2. The remainder of patients received 135 mg/m2 (n=13), 175 mg/m2 (n=9), or 225 mg/m2 (n=3). Thirty four patients (91.9%) received received nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin (n=28, 75.7%), IP cisplatin (n=1, 2.7%), carboplatin and bevacizumab (n=3, 8.1%), or carboplatin and gemcitabine (n=2, 5.4%). Reasons for discontinuing nab-paclitaxel included completion of adjuvant therapy (n=16), progressive disease (n=18), toxicity (n=1), and death (n=1). There were no grade 4 complications identified during nab-paclitaxel administration. Grade 3 complications included: neutropenia (n=9), thrombocytopenia (n=4), anemia (n=1), and neurotoxicity (n=1). Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel is well-tolerated with no HSRs observed in this series of patients with prior taxane HSR. Given the important role of taxane therapy in nearly all gynecologic malignancies, administration of nab-paclitaxel should be considered prior to abandoning taxane therapy.Copyright © 2017.

N2  -  In recent years, the nanotechnology has offered researchers the opportunity to solve the problems caused by the vehicle of the standard and first formulation of paclitaxel (Taxol), while maximizing the proven antineoplastic activity of the drug against many solid tumors. Hence, different types of nanocarriers have been employed to improve the efficacy, safety, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile of this drug. To date, paclitaxel is the unique drug that is marketed in three different nanoplatforms for its parenteral delivery: polymeric nanoparticles (Abraxane), liposomes (Lipusu), and polymeric micelles (Genexol, Nanoxel and Paclical). Indeed, a fourth nanocarrier might be available soon, because phase III studies of OpaxioTM, a polymeric-conjugated, are near completion. Furthermore, other several nanoformulations are currently in various stages of clinical trials. Therefore, it is only through the critical analysis of clinical evidence from these studies that we can get a more concrete idea of what has been achieved with pharmaceutical nanotechnology so far. This review attempts to summarize current information available regarding the clinical status and the physicochemical characteristic of different nanocarriers for paclitaxel delivery in cancer therapy. We present an overview of the preclinical and clinical data of these systems including their pharmacokinetics, dose and administration, adverse events and clinical efficacy.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the three most widely used chemotherapeutic agents, together with doxorubicin and cisplatin, and is first or second line treatment for several types of cancers. In 2000, Taxol, the conventional formulation of PTX, became the best-selling cancer drug of all time with annual sales of 1.6 billion. In 2005, the introduction of the albumin-based formulation of PTX, known as Abraxane, ended Taxol's monopoly of the PTX market. Abraxane's ability to push the Taxol innovator and generic formulations aside attracted fierce competition amongst competitors worldwide to develop their own unique, new and improved formulation of PTX. At this time there are at least 18 companies focused on pre-clinical and/or clinical development of nano-formulations of PTX. These pharmaceutical companies are investing substantial capital to capture a share of the lucrative global PTX market. It is hoped that any formulation that dominates the market will result in tangible benefits to patients in terms of both survival and quality of life. Given all of this activity, here we address the question: Who is going to win the battle of "nano" paclitaxel?Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Albumin-bound paclitaxel colloidal nanoparticle (Abraxane) is an FDA approved anticancer formulation available in the market. It is a suspension which is currently used therapeutically for treating cancers of the breast, lung, and pancreas among others. CDF is a novel new and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is widely used for breast and ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to use biocompatible albumin as well as folate decorated albumin to formulate colloidal nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin difluorinated (CDF). CDF has demonstrated a 16-fold improvement in stability and remarkable anticancer potency compared to its natural derivative, curcumin. CDF showed marked inhibition of cancer cell growth through down-regulation of multiple miRNAs, up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and attenuation of histone methyl transferase EZH2. However, CDF is highly hydrophobic and photodegradable with sparing aqueous solubility. In this study, we have formulated albumin nanoparticle using a modified desolvation method, which yielded high CDF loading in a nanoformulation. The physicochemical properties of CDF loaded albumin and folate-decorated albumin nanosuspensions were assessed for particle size, morphology, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency/loading, solubility and drug release. Importantly, the folate ligand decorated albumin nanoparticles were formulated in principle to passively and actively target folate-overexpressing-cancers. In this study, the synthesis and optimization of BSA and folate decorated BSA conjugated CDF nanoparticles are assessed in detail that will be useful for its future clinical translation.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Aim: The microtubule-associated Tau protein is a marker of paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the function of the Tau protein in epithelial ovarian cancer. Method(s): The correlation between Tau protein expression and the response to paclitaxel by using several ovarian cancer cell lines was investigated. Result(s): A Western blot showed that the expression level of the Tau protein was the highest in the TOV112D cells. A cell-counting kit showed that the proliferation rates were more inhibited in the cells with down-regulated Tau protein than in the control cells, both with and without paclitaxel treatment. The proliferation rates of the control cells and the TOV112D cells also were compared with Tau protein overexpression. The level of cell proliferation was more inhibited in the cells that overexpressed the Tau protein, compared to the control cells, both with and without paclitaxel treatment. It was shown that both the down-regulation and the overexpression of the Tau protein were related to the inhibition of TOV112D cell proliferation. Early and late apoptosis of the TOV112D cells that were transfected with Tau cDNA plasmid construct or Tau small interfering RNA significantly increased. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that the molecular targeting of the Tau protein could be a potential treatment for ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

N2  -  Purpose: MDSCs and macrophages have been reported to be increased in the tumor microenvironment by chemotherapy treatment. These cells may limit the beneficial effects of chemotherapy by limiting drug access or by suppressing the tumor targeted immune response evoked by the chemotherapy. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ability of chemokine receptor CCR2 inhibitor, PF-04136309, to block tumor MDSC and macrophage accumulation and to investigate the combination of this treatment with standard of care chemotherapies. Experimental design: The ability of CCR2 inhibitor, PF-04136309, to reduce tumor growth in mice was evaluated using orthotopically or SC injected syngeneic colon, pancreatic and ovarian tumor cell lines. PF-04136309 was evaluated as single agent, in combination with doxorubicin, or in the combination of gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Result(s): In a model of ovarian carcinomatosis (ID8), where tumor progression is driven by MDSCs and macrophages, single agent PF-04136309 reduced peritoneal tumor load as well as the total volume and rate of ascites fluid production. Even delayed treatment of established tumors, at 6 weeks post tumor inoculation, was effective. Ascites volume correlated with overall tumor load in treated mice. The treatment of ovarian tumor bearing mice with PF-04136309 in combination with doxorubicin, resulted in significant reduction in tumor load and ascites formation, beyond that produced by doxorubicin alone. To evaluate the addition of PF-04136309 to the chemotherapy combination, gemcitabine/paclitaxel, we selected models of pancreatic (Pan02) and colon (MC38) carcinoma, where PF-04136309 did not show single agent efficacy. The addition of PF-04136309 resulted in significantly decreased tumor burden compared to mice treated with chemotherapy alone. To investigate the mechanism of action of PF-04136309 we selected the MC38 model. PF-04136309 treatment of MC38 tumor bearing mice resulted in a substantial reduction, as a proportion of CD45+ cells, of MDSCs (CD11b+MHCII-Ly6C+) in the circulation (80%), and of MDSCs (60%) and macrophages (CD11b+F4/80+MHCII+Ly6C/G-) (70%) in the tumor, respectively. Conclusion(s): PF-04136309 significantly improved the response to several chemotherapeutics, providing strong rationale for CCR2 antagonism as an addition to standard of care chemotherapies. PF-04136309 is currently being evaluated in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. The observed inhibitory effect of PF-04136309 on ID8 ascites formation, the synergy with doxorubicin, and the known intervention of MDSC and macrophages in human ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis, suggests potential clinical efficacy with reduction of ascites volume and synergy in combination with pegylated doxorubicin in platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients.

N2  -  The role of activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the response of several solid tumor types to chemotherapy has been reported by several groups. Skor et al1 have demonstrated that the non-selective GR antagonist mifepristone can potentiate the effect of paclitaxel in a mouse xenograft derived from a human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line. GR activation is thought to play a role in the regulation of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Isikbay et al2 have demonstrated the benefits of combining androgen deprivation therapy with GR antagonism in prostate cancer xenograft model. Signaling via GR appears to be able to compensate for lack of androgen receptor signaling, and to contribute to castrate resistance. CORT125134 is a novel, selective GR antagonist being developed for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors, in combination with an appropriate standard of care agent. CORT125134 is currently being studied in a Phase1/2 study in solid tumors, in combination with nab-paclitaxel. The efficacy of CORT125134 in combination with standard of care agents has been investigated in mouse xenograft models of several tumor types. Previous reports of the benefit of adding a GR antagonist to chemotherapy in a TNBC model and an ovarian cancer model have been confirmed. An enhancement of the anti-tumor effect of castration by the addition of a GR antagonist has been confirmed in a model of prostate cancer. In addition, CORT125134 has been shown to provide a significant improvement in the efficacy of paclitaxel in a pancreatic cancer model. In a MIAPaca-2 xenograft model, paclitaxel was given i.v. every 4 days either alone or in combination with CORT125134. The combination provided significantly better tumor group inhibition than paclitaxel alone (p<0.0001). These encouraging results in a pancreatic cancer model extend the potential utility of GR antagonism in a variety of solid tumor types. In the TNBC model, alternative dosing regimens have been investigated, and suggest that stress during dosing is a confounding factor in these studies.

N2  -  Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed in both men and women. Dysregulation of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway is the most commonly mutated pathway in CRC. R-spondins (RSPO), a family of secreted proteins, are enhancers of WNT signaling. Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated that WNT inhibition results in superior antitumor efficacy in combination with taxanes. This superior combinatorial activity with taxanes has been identified in lung, ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancers. Taxanes have been found to be generally ineffective in the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer. Analysis of the local microenvironment, or stem cell niche, has identified stromal cells as an abundant source of RSPO. In patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX), the murine stromal cells replace human stromal cells and provide the microenvironment that supports tumor cell growth. We have classified PDX tumors as human RSPO3 high or low/negative using RNA sequencing and by expression studies. Inhibition of RSPO3 with OMP-131R10, a clinical stage therapeutic antibody which binds to human and murine RSPO3, has demonstrated efficacy in human RSPO3 high, APC PDX. Purpose(s): Common features in CRC are mutations in APC or beta-catenin which are present in approximately 90% of cases. Tumors with RSPO3 genomic translocation and/or overexpression of RSPO3 are generally APC and beta-catenin , and thus RSPO overexpression represents an alternative mechanism to upregulate the Wnt pathway. Alternatively, RSPO3 may be secreted by murine stromal cells, or by a rare population of tumor cells. In this study, we tested OMP-131R10 in combination with taxane treatment in human RSPO3 low CRC PDX models with APC or beta-catenin mutations and in a PDX model with a RSPO3 translocation. Result(s): Anti-RSPO3 was highly effective in combination with nab-paclitaxel in a CRC model with an RSPO3 translocation and RSPO3 overexpression. Furthermore, the combination of OMP-131R10 and taxane treatment resulted in synergistic inhibition of tumor growth in 8/10 PDX models with APC or beta -catenin mutations and low human tumor cell RSPO3 expression. Tumor regression or durable stable disease was evident in 6/8 models. Responsive models contained either heterozygous inactivating mutations in APC (6/8) or homozygous activating mutations in beta-catenin (2/8). Combination of OMP-131R10 with paclitaxel potentiated mitotic arrest, enhanced terminal differentiation and reduced the tumorigenic cell frequency by 40 fold based on serial transplantation studies. Conclusion(s): Anti-RSPO3 (OMP-131R10) was active in the majority of CRC PDX models tested when combined with taxane treatment. These CRC models harbored mutations in APC and beta-catenin. This data indicates that RSPO3 inhibition is an effective means to target the mutated Wnt pathway in CRC, and that antagonizing RSPO3 in combination with paclitaxel may improve survival for CRC patients.

N2  -  Background: Prognostic nomograms have been developed in various cancers, including ovarian, breast, and gastrointestinal; however, there is limited information on nomograms in MPC. The large, phase 3 MPACT study of nab-P + Gem vs Gem alone for the treatment of MPC provides a robust database for the development of a nomogram to predict OS using baseline patient variables. Method(s): A multivariable Cox model was created from MPACT data using factors that were significantly predictive of OS in univariable analysis or considered clinically important (stepwise selection to remain in model). From the Cox model, a nomogram was derived that assigned points equal to the weighted sum of relative significance of each variable. The nomogram was internally validated using bootstrapping, a concordance index (c-index), and calibration plots. Result(s): Data from all 861 pts were used. Seven of the 34 considered variables were retained in the multivariable analysis (Table; all factors significant at the P< 0.01 level, except for analgesic use [P = 0.07]). The resulting nomogram was able to distinguish low (n = 216), medium (n = 430), and high (n = 215) risk groups (c-index: 0.69; CI: 0.67-0.71) with median OS values of 12.9, 8.2, and 3.7 months, respectively. Calibration curves showed that the nomogram's predicted probabilities were mostly consistent with observed probabilities for 6-, 9-, and 12-month OS. Conclusion(s): Treatment arm, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albumin level, sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD), and presence of liver metastasis were the key predictors of OS. This nomogram, which will be presented in visual format in the final presentation, may help physicians and pts make informed treatment decisions. (Table Presented).

N2  -  Background: Gemcitabine (gem) with nab-paclitaxel (nab-p) is known to have antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile. The addition of bevacizumab (bev) to nab-paclitaxel has also been found to enhance nab-paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Method(s): We therefore performed a modified 3+3 dose escalation study with 15 dose levels of fixed dose gem 1000 mg/m2 IV (day 1, 8, 15) and escalating doses of nab-p IV (day 1,8, 15) and bev IV (day 1,15) every 28 days. The study design allowed for the possibility of multiple MTDs. Correlative studies on VEGF polymorphism and response were planned. (NCT01113476). Result(s): 103 patients (45 male) with advanced cancers were enrolled (19 ovarian, 18 pancreatic, and 18 gastroesophageal (GE) cancers among the most common). All patients were ECOG PS 0-2, median age was 60 years (range 17-85), and 51 patients (50%) were gem refractory with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. 3 DLTs were observed during dose escalation - one with nab-p 50 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 (grade 3 dysphagia, dehydration), one with nab-p 75 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 (grade 3 cellulitis) and one with nab-p 150 mg/m2 and bev 5 mg/m2 (grade 3 bacteremia, hypotension). 2 DLTs were observed among the 13 patients in the nab-p 100 mg/m2 and bev 5 mg/m2 expansion cohort (one grade 3 diarrhea, one grade 3 fatigue) and 1 DLT among the 12 patients in the nab-p 75 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 expansion cohort (grade 3 rectal bleed). Dose escalation up to nab-p 125 mg/m2 and bev 15 mg/m2 was well tolerated with no MTD. One patient with gem refractory peritoneal papillary carcinoma achieved a complete response, 13 patients (13%) had partial responses (PR), and 54 patients (52%) had prolonged stable disease (pSD) >= 12 weeks. 4 patients achieving PR and 26 patients with pSD were previously gem refractory. 3/6 (50%) small cell cancers achieved PR and all 6 of these patients had tumor shrinkage of at least 25%. 4/19 (21%) ovarian cancers achieved PR, 3/18 (17%) GE cancers achieved PR, and 1/18 (6%) pancreatic cancers achieved PR. Conclusion(s): The combination of gem 1000 mg/m2 , nab-p 125 mg/m2 and bev 15 mg/m2 is safe, well-tolerated, and has activity even at lower doses in advanced malignancies, including gem refractory tumors. Correlative VEGF polymorphism studies are ongoing.

N2  -  Background: Family history of BRCA-related tumors may correlate with response to chemotherapy and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). We retrospectively compared family history of such cancers with clinical outcomes and underlying molecular aberrations. Method(s): A retrospective chart review was conducted of 350 metastatic PC patients treated with first line FOLFIRINOX and Gem/Abraxane at MDACC from 1/2010 -1/2016. Family history was defined as 1 through 3 generation relatives with breast, ovarian, or pancreas cancer. Germline DNA was collected and sequenced using a familial cancer panel using an Illumina 2500. Average coverage was 200X. Platypus calls were analyzed for germline mutations. We assessed mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, MMR genes, ATM, and PolE. Result(s): Average age was 61. 60% of patients were male. We sequenced blood and tissue samples where available. We found at lease one mutation in 47 of 129 patients tested. There were 56 mutations identified among the 47 patients. Of patients with 0-1,2, or 3 or more affected family members we found mutations in 44%, 47%, and 29%, respectively. Patients with 3+ family members affected tended to have mutations in BRCA1 or PolE. Among the subset of patients with possible deleterious mutations, there were trends towards improved survival in pts with BRCA or PALB aberrations (307d vs 271d, p = ns) but worse outcomes in those with MMR gene defects (181d vs 387d, p = .126). Table 1 indicates outcomes based on number of family members with cancer and their associated mutations. Conclusion(s): Approximately one third of all patients tested had at least one germline mutation in previously described familial pancreas cancer genes. Screening for inherited cancer susceptibility genes may have prognostic value.

N2  -  Objective: Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic kinase promoting cell growth and metastasis. Preclinical studies show FAK inhibitors selectively target cancer stem cells (CSCs). We test the hypothesis that elevated FAK activity in ovarian cancer (OC) correlates with cisplatin-resistance, and that FAK inhibition can be used to suppress CSC growth, thereby potentiating cisplatin-induced cell death. Method(s): Growth of paired cisplatin-resistant and cisplatin-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell lines was evaluated in methylcellulose with FAK inhibitor VS-4718 and carboplatin and paclitaxel. Protein expression of phosphorylated FAK and cancer stem cell markers ALDH and OCT 4 were determined using Western blot analysis. Quantification of cancer stem-like activity was determined using flow cytometry and secondary tumor-initiating capacity. Intraperitoneal tumor growth in mice was evaluated for combined inhibitory effects of platinum and paclitaxel chemotherapy with FAK inhibitor. Result(s): We find FAK activation is elevated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer, and FAK phosphorylation is increased after cisplatin treatment. FAK inhibitor selectively blocked cisplatin-resistant cell growth. Coadministration of VS-4718 in vitro and in mice reduced cisplatin-resistant ovarian cell growth, with a concomitant decrease in ALDH, a marker of CSCs. Residual ovarian tumor cells from VS-4718-treated mice exhibit reduced secondary tumor-initiating capacity. The use of VS-4718 in combination with cisplatin and paclitaxel in mice with cisplatin-resistant xenografts resulted in a decrease in tumor growth that was equivalent to that seen in mice having cisplatin-sensitive tumors. Conclusion(s): CSCs are implicated as a cause of cisplatin resistance. We found that increased FAK phosphorylation occurs as a function of acquired cisplatin resistance and that FAK activity sustains ovarian carcinoma CSC phenotypes. Since FAK inhibitors preferentially target CSCs and have now exhibited increased activity in cisplatin-resistant cells, our results support the testing of FAK inhibitors with platinum and paclitaxel in humans with cisplatin-resistant cancer. We are currently in the process of implementing a phase I/II clinical trial to further investigate this effect in humans.

N2  -  Background: TNBC patients with homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumors have significantly higher pathologic complete response (pCR, ypTO/is ypNO) rates when treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. TILs are prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit in TNBC. Interestingly, recent data suggests that HR deficient TNBCs and BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancers may be enriched for immune cell infiltration. Thus, we performed a pooled analysis of 5 phase II studies that included patients with TNBC treated with neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy to evaluate the association of TILs with HR deficiency status and tumor BRCA1/2 mutation status. Method(s): 166 patients with TNBC and known HR deficiency status from the following clinical trials were available for analysis: PrECOG 0105 (N=72), NCT00580333 (N=32), NCT01372579 (N=26), TBCRC 008 (N=18) and NCT00148694 (N=18). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens included 1) carboplatin, gemcitabine, iniparib, 2) cisplatin with or without bevacizumab 3) carboplatin, eribulin, 4) carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, with or without vorinostat. HR deficiency status was defined as a high HRD score (42 or higher) and/or presence of a BRCA1/2 tumor mutation (tBRCA). Digitized pre-treatment core biopsy H&E sections were reviewed and scored by two blinded expert breast cancer pathologists using the international TIL working group guidelines. The density (%) of both intratumoral TILs (iTILs) and stromal TILs (sTILs) was recorded by deciles (n=122 thus far, additional cases to be included in final analysis). Result(s): Among 122 patients, pCR was achieved in 36 patients (29.5%) and 71 tumors (58.2%) were HR deficient. In total, 24 patients (19.7%) patients had a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation. Among all tumors, iTIL and sTIL median densities were 0% (range 0-20) and 10% (range 0-80), respectively, and were not statistically different in HR deficient versus non-deficient tumors (iTIL p=0.746; sTIL p=0.159). The same absent association was observed for tBRCA mutation status (iTIL p=0.607; sTIL p=0.315) and binary HRD score (iTIL p=0.879; sTIL p=0.364). Updated results with additional cases scored for TILs will be reported at time of presentation. Additional analyses assessing the relationship between TILs and pCR/residual cancer burden adjusting for HRD status and other clinical variables will also be included at the time of presentation. Conclusion(s): Several previous studies have reported that TILs are significantly associated with response to standard chemotherapy regimens when given in the neoadjuvant setting. Measures of genomic instability and DNA repair deficiency, including HRD, have been shown to be robust predictors of response to chemotherapy, including platinum containing regimens. It is unclear if TILs will be predictive in a similarly robust way for response to platinum-containing regimens. Results of this study suggest TIL density and HR deficiency status may be independent and non-overlapping. Final analysis including additional cases will be included in the final presentation.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer remains the most common cause of death due to gynecologic cancers, and due to its ambiguous symptomatology, diagnosis often occurs at late stages, and prognosis is poor. This case report describes the compassionate use of an oncolytic adenovirus, ONCOS-102, in a 46-year-old female with Stage IV treatment- refractory serous ovarian cancer presenting with metastases to the groin and left breast, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and pleural carcinomatosis. The patient was initially diagnosed in 2007 with a low-grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary (pT3, pN1, pMx, G1), c-kit-positive, ER-positive, HER2/EGFR-negative, BRAF -negative and KRAS mutation-negative. Since then, the patient had received multimodal chemotherapy followed by multiple courses of maintenance therapy, with treatments including Bevacizumab (Avastin), Diflunisal/ASA, PAS/ASA, Abraxane, Tamoxifen, Alimta, Gemcitabine, and Topotecan. The patient had also received abandoned radiotherapy and dendritic cell vaccine immunization. Oncos Therapeutics provided ONCOS-102 for compassionate use, based on the rationale that there was no satisfactory alternative treatment, and she was unable to obtain the drug under another IND or clinical trial protocol. ONCOS-102 (Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF) is an oncolytic adenovirus that, due to a 24-bp deletion in its E1A gene, selectively replicates in cancer cells with a defective Rb pathway, and its Ad5 fiber knob protein is replaced with that of Ad3 to facilitate entry into tumor cells. In addition, the virus is armed with a transgene encoding granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thus, ONCOS-102 is hypothesized to mediate therapeutic benefit through multiple mechanisms, including direct oncolysis of tumor cells, triggering necrosis/apoptosis via vascular disruption, and activation of innate and adaptive immunity, leading to the induction of a systemic anti-tumor response. Thus, oncolytic virotherapy can be viewed as a form of in situ vaccination, and to further potentiate its effects, our single-patient compassionate use protocol further incorporated a low priming dose of cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 IV bolus) for Treg depletion, and a dual checkpoint inhibitor treatment regimen with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (1 mg/kg). Approval for the use of this protocol in this patient was obtained from the FDA, as well as the University of Miami's local Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The patient passed pre-treatment evaluations and informed consent was obtained for administration of the virus, which was performed following the cyclophosphamide "priming" regimen at a virus dose of 3 x 10^11 VP by intralesional injection into accessible tumors. No product-related adverse events have been observed, and further clinical results will be presented.

N2  -  Background and objective: The access to investigational drugs for patients who are not included in a clinical trial and without authorized therapeutic alternatives is known as compassionate use. The incorporation of the evidence-based medicine in the area of oncohaematology has implied that an important part of clinic therapy validated by evidence that could not be controlled from an administrative point of view. This is due to the continuous and progressive development of investigation and information on cancer treatment and the delay of the administration regulation. The use of drugs in this way is regulated by Royal Decree 1015/2009 (19/6). The objective of the study is to describe the use of cancer drugs through compassionate use in the last 5 years in a specialty hospital. Setting and method: Descriptive retrospective study on a specialty hospital. All the applications for a compassionate use drugs were analysed from January 2011 until October 2015. The data were obtained from medical records programme Diraya and from an Excel database of medicines in compassionate use of the Pharmacy Service. Main Outcome Measure(s): The following variables were registered: * Number of patient clinic history * Authorized medicine * Authorization date * Applicant Service Results: We recorded 80 requests of cancer drugs in compassionate use during the 5 years of study. Oncology was the service that recorded more authorizations with 95%, followed with Gynaecology with 2.5% and finally Endocrinology and Haematology with 1.25%. 64 drugs of the 80 requests were approved (80%) and 16 unauthorized (20%) in the 5 years of study. The year in which more applications were received was 2013 (31.25%) and the least requests were received in 2012 (6.25%), being the year where all requests were authorized. In 2015 fewer applications were authorized, 75%. In the years 2011, 2013 and 2014 were authorized 88.3, 76 and 88.3%, respectively. A total of 34 different active drugs were received during the study, the most requested Bevacizumab (24%) for grade III oligoastrocytoma, ovarian cancer (monotherapy), metastatic gall bladder cancer and metastatic platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, Everolimus (18%) for indications of neuroendocrine carcinoid tumour and metastatic breast cancer, Nab-paclitaxel (18%) for invasive lobular carcinoma indications of high-grade and metastatic pancreatic cancer, ipilimumab (12%) for the indication of metastatic melanoma, and Regorafenib for indications of colorectal cancer and metastatic GIST I pre-treat with imatinib (12%). Conclusion(s): The solicitude of drugs through compassionate use needs effective commissions of Pharmacy and Therapeutics, along with the Medical Management to establish an agile and faster requesting circuit and the consequent use monitoring.

N2  -  Background:Pembrolizumab (P) is an anti-PD-1 antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T-cells and PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumour cells. A phase Ib trial of P plus chemotherapy was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy. Method(s):Patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumours were enrolled onto one of six treatment arms. Pembrolizumab was given: with gemcitabine (G), G+docetaxel (D), G+nab-paclitaxel (NP), G+vinorelbine (V) or irinotecan (I) until progression or toxicity, or with liposomal doxorubicin (LD) for up to 15 cycles, progression or toxicity. Safety monitoring and response assessments were conducted. Result(s):Forty-nine patients were enrolled and treated. The most common adverse events were transaminitis, cytopenias, rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Arm 2 was closed due to poor accrual. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined for Arms 1, 3a, 4, 5 and 6. There were eight partial responses across multiple tumour types. Conclusion(s):Standard dose P can be safely combined with G, G+NP, G+V, I and LD. Efficacy was observed in multiple tumour types and evaluation to determine if response and duration of response are more robust than what would be expected for chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone requires further validation.Copyright © 2017 Cancer Research UK.

N2  -  The intraperitoneal (IP) administration of antineoplastic agents has been proposed as a method to improve the efficacy of therapy of malignant disease principally confined to the peritoneal cavity especially in carcinoma-ovary. Our patient who had more tumor burden in the peritoneum was refractory to two lines intravenous (IV) chemotherapy who improved on IP administration of platinum and IV nab paclitaxel chemotherapy regime. A 42-year-old lady was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer. She suffered from progressive disease on two lines of IV chemotherapy following surgery with persistent rise in serum CA 125 level. Administration of IP platinum and IV nab paclitaxel chemotherapy regime resulted in complete (metabolic/radiological) response with normal CA 125 level. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be considered in patients with ovarian cancer with predominantly peritoneal disease.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.

N2  -  Background Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates immunity via recruitment of antigen presenting cells and tumor specific T-cell stimulation. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) followed by GM-CSF may enhance antitumor responses and prolong remissions in ovarian cancer. Immune phenotypes present before treatment may identify responders to chemo-immunotherapy. Methods Recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer patients received nab-paclitaxel, 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 followed by GM-CSF 250 mug days 16-26 every 28 days for 6 planned cycles. The primary endpoint was remission duration compared to immediate prior remission. Peripheral blood was evaluated by flow cytometry and interferon-gamma ELISPOT. Results Twenty-one patients were enrolled. Six patients (29%) achieved a biochemical complete response and 9 (43%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 72%. Median time to progression was 4 months and 10% of patients achieved longer remissions than the immediate prior regimen. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months. Fewer myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) at enrollment significantly associated with complete response (p = 0.05). T-cell responses to IGF1R-p1332-1346 (r = 0.827, p = 0.0003) and IGF1R-p1242-1256 (r = 0.850, p = 0.0001) during treatment correlated with time to progression. Conclusions Nab-paclitaxel combined with GM-CSF demonstrated biochemical responses in a majority of patients, although responses were not sustained. This combination did not demonstrate an advantage in OS over prior studies of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Agents that modulate MDSC should be studied as potential adjuvants to therapy. Strategies to expand T cells recognizing tumor-associated antigens biologically significant in ovarian cancer should also continue to be investigated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Forced expression of the cytokine-induced large GTPase, human Guanylate-Binding Protein-1 (hGBP-1), in ovarian cancer cell lines increases resistance to paclitaxel. Elevated hGBP-1 RNA in ovarian tumors correlates with shorter recurrence-free survival. In contract, hGBP-1 is part of a gene signature predicting improved prognosis in all subtypes of breast cancers. hGBP-1 does not confer paclitaxel resistance on MCF-7 and TMX2-28 breast cancer cells. Expression of the isotype of the hGBP-1-interacting protein, PIM1, which may contribute to paclitaxel resistance when associated with hGBP-1, is different in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell lines express the 44 kDa isoform of PIM-1, and ovarian cancer cell lines express the 33 kDa isoform.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) are among the most commonly prescribed anticancer drugs approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancers, as well as in the adjuvant setting for operable node-positive breast cancers. Although the true incidence of dermatological adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving taxanes is not known, and has never been prospectively analysed, they clearly represent one of the major AEs associated with these agents. With an increase in the occurrence of cutaneous AEs during treatment with novel targeted and immunological therapies when used in combination with taxanes, a thorough understanding of reactions attributable to this class is imperative. Moreover, identification and management of dermatological AEs is critical for maintaining the quality of life in cancer patients and for minimizing dose modifications of their antineoplastic regimen. This analysis represents a systematic review of the dermatological conditions reported with the use of these drugs, complemented by experience at comprehensive cancer centres. The conditions reported herein include skin, hair, and nail toxicities. Lastly, we describe the dermatological data available for the new, recently FDA-and EMA- approved, solvent-free nab-paclitaxel.Copyright © 2016 John Libbey Eurotext.

N2  -  Here, we report the development of an antibody-drug conjugate, ASG-5ME, which targets the solute carrier receptor SLC44A4. SLC44A4 is a member of a family of putative choline transporters that we show to be markedly upregulated in a variety of epithelial tumors, most notably prostate and pancreatic cancer. SLC44A4 is normally expressed on the apical surface of secretory epithelial cells, but in cancer we show expression is not restricted to the luminal surface in advanced and undifferentiated tumors. ASG-5ME consists of a human IgG2 anti-SLC44A4 antibody conjugated through a cleavable linker to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethylauristatin E. It has potent antitumor activity in both cell line- and patient-derived xenograft models of pancreatic and prostate cancers. Combination studies with ASG- 5ME and nab-paclitaxel demonstrated combination effect in both pancreatic and prostate tumor models. Altogether, the data presented here suggest that ASG-5ME may have the potential to offer a new therapeutic option for the treatment of pancreatic and prostate cancers.Copyright © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Peritoneal carcinomatosis is present in more than 60% of gastric cancer, 40% of ovarian cancer, and 35% of colon cancer patients. It is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with a median survival of 1 to 3 months. Cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy is the current clinical treatment, but achieving curative drug accumulation and penetration in peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we used flexible and pH-sensitive polymersomes for payload delivery to peritoneal gastric (MKN-45P) and colon (CT26) carcinoma in mice. Polymersomes were loaded with paclitaxel and in vitro drug release was studied as a function of pH and time. Paclitaxelloaded polymersomes remained stable in aqueous solution at neutral pH for up to 4 months. In cell viability assay on cultured cancer cell lines (MKN-45P, SKOV3, CT26), paclitaxelloaded polymersomes were more toxic than free drug or albuminbound paclitaxel (Abraxane). Intraperitoneally administered fluorescent polymersomes accumulated in malignant lesions, and immunofluorescence revealed an intense signal inside tumors with no detectable signal in control organs. A dual targeting of tumors was observed: direct (circulationindependent) penetration, and systemic, blood vessel-associated accumulation. Finally, we evaluated preclinical antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel-polymersomes in the treatment of MKN-45P disseminated gastric carcinoma using a total dose of 7 mg/kg. Experimental therapy with paclitaxel-polymersomes improved the therapeutic index of drug over free paclitaxel and Abraxane, as evaluated by intraperitoneal tumor burden and number of metastatic nodules. Our findings underline the potential utility of the polymersome platform for delivery of drugs and imaging agents to peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions.Copyright © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with unresectable or metastatic disease with very poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, but the efficacy of currently available regimens is limited. Taxanes are widely used in many primary cancers including breast, ovarian and lung cancers. The activity of combined regimen of taxanes plus nucleoside analogue or platinum derivate in terms of response rate ranges between 20 and 57 % in PDAC and may prolong overall survival. Since 2013 nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel-albumin-bound particles) became a new treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the results of MPACT trial. Moreover, encouraging activity in PDAC of the combination regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin that is being widely used in other solid tumors has been reported recently. Biomarkers, including biomarkers predictive of taxane resistance, could allow individualized tailored therapy. BRCA mutation status could serve as predictor of better chemotherapy treatment outcome in PDAC. The present review summarizes the principal clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of taxanes both as monotherapy and in combination in view of the potential use in the treatment of PDAC.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  -  The classical taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), the newer taxane cabazitaxel and the nanoparticle-bound nab-paclitaxel are among the most widely used anticancer drugs. The taxanes share the characteristics of extensive hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, the need for dose adaptation in patients with liver dysfunction, and a substantial pharmacokinetic variability even after taking into account known covariates. Data from clinical studies suggest that optimal scheduling of the taxanes is dependent not only on the specific taxane compound, but also on the tumor type and line of treatment. Still, the optimal dosing regimen (weekly vs 3 weekly) and optimal dose of the taxanes are controversial, as is the value of pharmacological personalization of taxane dosing. In this article, an overview is given on the pharmacological properties of the taxanes, including metabolism, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and aspects in the clinical use of taxanes. The latter includes the ongoing debate on the most active and safe regimen, the recommended initial dose and the issue of therapeutic drug dosing.Copyright © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  -  Demcizumab (OMP-21M18) is a novel anti-DLL4 (delta-like protein 4) humanized monoclonal antibody (MAb) developed by researchers at OncoMed Pharmaceuticals. In preclinical studies demcizumab demonstrated the ability to block Notch signaling and inhibit tumor growth through multiple mechanisms, such as the reduction of cancer stem cell frequency and the inhibition of angiogenesis. Phase I data demonstrated that demcizumab was generally well tolerated and had promising antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. This anti-DLL4 MAb is currently being tested in additional phase I and phase II studies in combination with gemcitabine with or without nabpaclitaxel in pancreatic cancer, with FOLFIRI in colorectal cancer, with carboplatin and pemetrexed in lung cancer and with paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.Copyright © 2016 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

N2  -  Background: The dynamic changes that occur in protein expression after treatment of a cancer in vivo are poorly described. In this study we measure the effect of chemotherapy over time on the expression of a panel of proteins in ovarian cancer xenograft models. The objective was to identify phosphoprotein and other protein changes indicative of pathway activation that might link with drug response. Method(s): Two xenograft models, platinum-responsive OV1002 and platinum-unresponsive HOX424, were used. Treatments were carboplatin and carboplatin-paclitaxel. Expression of 49 proteins over 14 days post treatment was measured by quantitative immunofluorescence and analysed by AQUA. Result(s): Carboplatin treatment in the platinum-sensitive OV1002 model triggered up-regulation of cell cycle, mTOR and DDR pathways, while at late time points WNT, invasion, EMT and MAPK pathways were modulated. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) and ERBB pathways were down-regulated early, within 24 h from treatment administration. Combined carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment triggered a more extensive response in the OV1002 model modulating expression of 23 of 49 proteins. Therefore the cell cycle and DDR pathways showed similar or more pronounced changes than with carboplatin alone. In addition to expression of pS6 and pERK increasing, components of the AKT pathway were modulated with pAKT increasing while its regulator PTEN was down-regulated early. WNT signaling, EMT and invasion markers were modulated at later time points. Additional pathways were also observed with the NFKB and JAK/STAT pathways being up-regulated. ESR1 was down-regulated as was HER4, while further protein members of the ERBB pathway were upregulated late. By contrast, in the carboplatin-unresponsive HOX 424 xenograft, carboplatin only modulated expression of MLH1 while carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment modulated ESR1 and pMET. Conclusion(s): Thirteen proteins were modulated by carboplatin and a more robust set of changes by carboplatin-paclitaxel. Early changes included DDR and cell cycle regulatory proteins associating with tumor volume changes, as expected. Changes in ESR1 and ERBB signaling were also observed. Late changes included components of MAPK signaling, EMT and invasion markers and coincided in time with reversal in tumor volume reduction. These results suggest potential therapeutic roles for inhibitors of such pathways that may prolong chemotherapeutic effects.Copyright © 2016 Koussounadis et al.

N2  -  Introduction:Paclitaxel and docetaxel were two epoch-making anticancer drugs and have been successfully used in chemotherapy for a variety of cancer types. In the year 2010, a new taxane, cabazitaxel, was approved by FDA for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nabTM-paclitaxel; abraxane) nanodroplet formulation was another notable invention (FDA approval 2005 for refractory, metastatic, or relapsed breast cancer). Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of pancreatic cancer was approved by FDA in 2013. Accordingly, there have been a huge number of patent applications dealing with taxane anticancer agents in the last 5 years. Thus, it is a good time to review the progress in this area and find the next wave for new developments.Area covered: This review covers the patent literature from the year 2010 to early 2015 on various aspects of taxane-based chemotherapies and drug developments.Expert opinion: Three FDA-approved taxane anticancer drugs will continue to expand their therapeutic applications, especially through drug combinations and new formulations. Inspired by the success of abraxane, new nano-formulations are emerging. Highly potent new-generation taxanes will play a key role in the development of efficacious tumor-targeted drug delivery systems.Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

N2  -  Objectives: In 2015, we demonstrated that a strong family history of BRCA related tumors portends a better prognosis in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients. We now investigate if this holds true for more recent patients treated with standard-of-care FOLFIRINOX (FNX) or Gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GA). We hypothesize that targeted sequencing of these tumors for DNA repair pathway aberrations will better predict outcomes than the surrogate marker of family history, which may be subject to patient bias. Method(s): We identified patients with de novo stage 4 pancreatic cancer initially treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center with first-line FNX or GA. We excluded patients with prior surgical resection (bypass was allowed) or radiation as initial therapy, and patients with unknown family history. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): We identified 153 patients initially treated with FNX and 80 patients treated with GA. Median age of the entire cohort was 62 years (36-84), 58% were male. Median OS was 286 and 295 days, respectively. Approximately 5% of patients had a family history of 3 or more BRCA tumors (breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreas). Median OS for these patients was 469 days, as compared to 285, 268, and 296 days for patients with 0, 1, and 2 affected family members. Median survival in patients with 3+ family members affected was 463 days and 511 days for patients on FNX and GA respectively (95% CI 240-636d, 0-1092 d). For patients with 0-2 such family members, median OS was 283 and 268 days, respectively. As expected, ECOG 0-1 and the absence of liver metastases were associated with longer survival. We identified 126 of 153 FNX patients and 51 of 80 GA patients with pathology specimens available for targeted sequencing. Conclusion(s): As in our earlier report, we see a trend towards increased survival in patients with 3 or more family members with BRCA related tumors. However, the small number of these patients precludes a definitive assessment. We believe that targeted sequencing of DNA repair pathway and associated genes will better elucidate the mechanism of survival benefit over biased family history. (Figure presented).

N2  -  Paclitaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for solid tumors including breast, lung and ovarian cancers. It has been formulated as a nanoparticle formulation, Abraxane, to improve its solublity (0.350.7 mug/mL) and to avoid the use of harmful solvents like cremophor EL. We previously reported the next-generation Abraxane-Cynviloq-a polymeric micelle paclitaxel formulation which uses a chemical polymer instead of biological polymer to stabilize the nanoparticle [1]. Here we investigate and report the use of phospholipids instead of a chemical polymer for the creation of the next-generation Abraxane. The effect of lipid composition on drug loading and physical stability of paclitaxel-loaded lipid-coated nanoparticle formulation was evaluated before and after lyophilization. The nanoparticles were prepared by microfluidization-solvent evaporation method. The formulation parameters included type of phospholipids, phospholipid fatty acid chain length, ratio of phospholipid and lysophospholipid combination, and drugphospholipid ratio. The process parameters such as microfluidization pressure and number of microfluidization cycles were studied and their impact on drug loading, particle size and physical stability were evaluated. The short-term stability evaluation of nanoparticles prepared with different phospholipid ratios demonstrated that 4:1 as the optimum phospholipidlysophospholipid ratio to achieve a loading of more than 60% paclitaxel with particle size of approximately ~200nm. The nanoparticle size increased with an increase of carbon chain length of the phospholipid fatty acid, but no significant trends were observed for drug loading with changes in microfluidization pressure or number of cycles. The stability of the formulation was evaluated at different temperatures before and after lyophilization. The optimization of phospholipid composition, druglipid ratio, process parameters and additives for stability on lyophilization led to a physically stable paclitaxel-loaded phopholipid-coated nanoparticulate formulation that maintains size, charge and particulate integrity during storage. Phospholipid bound paclitaxel nanoparticle was successfully manufactured in lab scale with the desired properties. Scaling up and additional work-up for clinical evaluation is being evaluated.

N2  -  A quantitative MRI method, namely, temporal diffusion spectroscopy (TDS), has been used to measure tumor microstructural changes in response to a well-established antimitotic drug treatment (protein-bound paclitaxel) and evaluated as an early indicator of tumor responsiveness. Current radiological methods of monitoring treatment response in solid tumors rely on measuring changes in tumor size as measured by CT or MRI, and it is well recognized this approach suffers from major limitations. In recent years, tumor size measurements have been supplemented by a number of imaging techniques that aim for in vivo characterization and measurement of biologic processes at the cellular and molecular level, but to date none has proven robustly successful in practice. For example, diffusion MRI has shown a high sensitivity to tumor response, but a relatively lower specificity e.g. sometimes unable to distinguish real response of responder tumors from the progression of some non-responders. Temporal diffusion spectroscopy measures a series of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) over a wide range of effective diffusion times, corresponding to diffusion distances ranging from subcellular to cellular levels (~ 3-20 urn). By fitting the measured ADC spectra to a simplified tissue model, parameters reflecting structural properties (such as cell size) in tissues can be extracted. Abraxane, one of the most successful microtubule-targeted chemotherapeutic drugs, has been reported to induce aberrant mitosis in tumor cells leads to mitotic arrest, the consequence of which is a cell size increase. In the current study, we implemented TDS in Abraxane/PBS-treated two types of human ovarian xenografts and cultured cells (OVCAR-8 as a responder to Abraxane, and NCI/ADR-RES as a resistant type). Abraxane-induced cell size increases were confirmed by flow cytometry and light microscopy in cell culture. The efficacy of Abraxane in treating tumors in vivo was examined histologically by calculating percentages of Caspase-3- activated area within Caspase-3 stained slides. Most excitingly, the fitted restricted size, one of the spectral parameters obtained from TDS, was able to quantify cell size increases which were not detected by conventional diffusion-MRI. All the MR results had a high degree of consistency with other flow, microscopy, and histological data. Moreover, with an appropriate analysis, the Abraxane-responsive tumors in vivo could be easily distinguished from all the other drug-vehicle-treated tumors and Abraxaneresistant tumors. In conclusion, temporal diffusion spectroscopy detects antimitotic-therapy-induced microstructural variations (notably, increases in cell sizes) in tumors in vivo which occur before changes in tumor volume or conventional diffusion MRI metrics. A combination of restricted size and zero-frequency diffusion coefficient can potentially be used as an early indicator of tumor responsiveness.

N2  -  Background and Aims: To identified the differentially expressed proteins in taxol resistance samples of ovarian cancer. Method(s): The reserch was done between the 2 groups of taxol resistance and taxol sensitive samples of ovarian cancer by applicating iTRAQ labeling combined LC-MS/MS technology. The 4 different expression proteins including SART1, TKTL1, CD146, and HE4 were then analyzed further in 67cases of ovarian cancer tissue samples by using western blotting test. Result(s): 1. Total of 496 differentially expressed proteins were identified., up-regulated proteins were 263 and down-regulated proteins were 233. 2. Differentially expressed proteins were involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, systemic lupus erythematosus, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, complement and coagulation cascades, spliceosome, salivary secretion, methane metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, lysosome pathways. 3. Western blotting assay found that there were significant differences of SART1, TKTL1, CD146 and HE4 protein expressions between taxol sensitive protein group and resistance group in ovarian cancer tissues., consistent with the proteomic iTRAQ results. 4. The advanced stage (III) ovarian cancer showed higher SART1, TKTL1, CD146 and HE4 protein expressions level than early-stage (I/II) (P<0.05). Low-differentiated tissues (G3) showed higher HE4, CD146, TKTL1 protein expressions level than high-to moderate-differentiated (G1-G2) ovarian tissues (P<0.05). But SART1 was no significant difference in histological grades. Conclusion(s): The results indicated that SART1, TKTL1, CD146 and HE4 proteins may play a role in the taxol resistance development of ovarian cancer. These proteins may serve as potential targets for reversing the resistance to chemotherapy in ovarian cancers.

N2  -  Background: Aldoxorubicin (A) is a novel prodrug of doxorubicin (D) that binds covalently to albumin, accumulates in tumors and releases D under acidic conditions. It has demonstrated significant efficacy against soft tissue sarcomas in a phase 2b study versus D. Gemcitabine (G), when combined with various chemotherapies (albumin/paclitaxel nanoparticles, liposomal D) has demonstrated efficacy in patients with pancreatic, ovarian and lung cancers. It was hypothesized that A+G might possess synergistic activity against solid tumors. This study was designed to identifiy the major toxicities of this combination and establish its MTD. Method(s): Adults who had relapsed or not responded to prior chemotherapies were eligible. Initial cohorts were (i) A 170 mg/m2+ G 900 mg/m2 ); (ii) A 250 mg/m2 + G 900 mg/m2; and (iii) A 200 mg/m2 + G 750 mg/m2. A was administered on Day 1 and G on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 day cycle. Safety was monitored continuously, cardiac function was assessed every 2 months by echocardiogram, and tumor response every 6 weeks by CT scan. The MTD was defined as the dose level where < 3 of 6 subjects experienced a dose limiting toxicity. Result(s): 22 subjects have been entered with a median age of 60 years (20-71) with 5 males and 17 females entered. Tumor types included 10 sarcomas (soft tissue and skeletal) and 4 ovarian cancers. 2 PRs (uterine leiomyosarcoma and ovarian cancer), 11 SDs and 2 PDs as best responses were documented. Major grades 3 and 4 adverse events included neutropenia in 7 subjects, thrombocytopenia in 13 subjects and anemia in 8 subjects. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 2 subjects and pneumoinia in 1 subject. 11 SAEs have been observed that include Klebsiella infection, sepsis, fever, increased anemia, small bowel obstruction, stomatitis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia and UTI. No subjects exhibited an LVEF < 50% of normal at any evaluation; no treatment-related deaths occurred. The study is completing dosing of A 200 mg/m2 + G 500 mg/m2, considered the phase 2 doses. Conclusion(s): A + G can be administered safely at a recommended dose of 200 mg/m2 of A on Day 1 and 500 mg/m2 of G on Days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Thrombocytopenia is the major grade 3 or 4 AE that limits dosing.

N2  -  Background: Dexamethasone (Dex) is a synthetic glucocorticoid that is frequently co-administered with chemotherapy in ovarian and other cancers to alleviate side effects of chemotherapy on non-target tissues. However, in vitro and preclinical data show that Dex can induce stress response mechanisms in lung, breast and ovarian cancer cells, causing it to attenuate cytotoxicity of, and response to chemotherapeutic drugs when Dex is co-administered. This response has been suggested to be predicted by the expression status of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in lung and breast cancers. Therefore, establishing GR as a predictive biomarker of tumor response to Dex-combined chemotherapy would potentially enable clinical decision making with respect to the use of Dex during chemotherapy, particularly as alternative Dex-free treatments such as nab-paclitaxel are now available. We therefore undertook to examine the distribution of GR expression within various subtypes of ovarian tumors as a first step toward exploring GR as a predictor of chemotherapy response in ovarian neoplasms. Design(s): Tissue microarrays of 286 ovarian tumors, each case represented in triplicate, were semi-quantitatively assessed for GR immunohistochemical expression using H-score (negative staining defined as weak to no staining H-score<50 while strong diffuse staining as that with H-score>=200). Descriptive statistics and Fischer's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Of the 286 cases examined, 244 tumors (85%) showed GR expression (Table 1), 193 (79%) of which with strong diffuse positivity. Among ovarian epithelial carcinomas, type 2 cancers were more likely to be GR positive (190 of 205, 93% vs. 47 of 74, 64%; p< 0.0001), with more cases exhibiting strong diffuse positivity (149 of 205, 73% vs. 37 of 74, 50%; p= 0.0005). Conclusion(s): This is the first report of a comprehensive study of GR status in ovarian tumors, demonstrating highly variable GR expression profile both among subtypes of ovarian cancer and within each, subtype suggesting that tumor GR status may be a major determinant of the variability in response of ovarian cancer patients to chemotherapy. Pathologic subgroups of patients identified as expressing high GR may also be candidates for novel treatments that use GR antagonists. (Table Presented).

N2  -  PURPOSE: A novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, namely, temporal diffusion spectroscopy (TDS), was used to detect the response of tumor cells (notably, mitotic arrest) to a specific antimitotic treatment (Nab-paclitaxel) in culture and human ovarian xenografts and evaluated as an early imaging biomarker of tumor responsiveness. METHOD(S): TDS measures a series of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of tissue water over a range of effective diffusion times, which may correspond to diffusion distances ranging from subcellular to cellular levels (~ 3-20 mum). By fitting the measured ADC data to a tissue model, parameters reflecting structural properties such as restriction size in solid tumors can be extracted. Two types of human ovarian cell lines (OVCAR-8 as a responder to Nab-paclitaxel and NCI/ADR-RES as a resistant type) were treated with either vehicle (PBS) or Nab-paclitaxel, and treatment responses of both in vitro and in vivo cases were investigated using TDS. RESULT(S): Acute cell size increases induced by Nab-paclitaxel in responding tumors were confirmed by flow cytometry and light microscopy in cell culture. Nab-paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest in treated tumors/cells was quantified histologically by measuring the mitotic index in vivo using a mitosis-specific marker (anti-phosphohistone H3). Changes in the fitted restriction size, one of the parameters obtained from TDS, were able to detect and quantify increases in tumor cell sizes. All the MR results had a high degree of consistency with other flow, microscopy, and histological data. Moreover, with an appropriate analysis, the Nab-paclitaxel-responsive tumors in vivo could be easily distinguished from all the other vehicle-treated and Nab-paclitaxel-resistant tumors. CONCLUSION(S): TDS detects increases in cell sizes associated with antimitotic-therapy-induced mitotic arrest in solid tumors in vivo which occur before changes in tissue cellularity or conventional diffusion MRI metrics. By quantifying changes in cell size, TDS has the potential to improve the specificity of MRI methods in the evaluation of therapeutic response and enable a mechanistic understanding of therapy-induced changes in tumors.Copyright © 2016 The Authors

Octreotide at different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 nmol/ml) were administrated to A2780/Taxol cells in vitro. CCK-8 assay was used to measure the effects on cell proliferation, and the cytometry of octreotide determined the cell apoptosis. The expressions of SSTR2 MDR1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay and the expressions of the above protein were investigated after A2780/Taxol was treated with octreotide for 48 hours by western blot in vitro. Result(s): Positive expression of SSTR2 was observed on the membrane of A2780/Taxol cells. The proliferation of A2780/Taxol cells was gradually inhibited with increasing octreotide concentration in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, flow cytometry data demonstrated the octreotide-induced cell apoptosis. The results of SSTR2 mRNA suggested that there was no significant difference between each concentration group of octreotide (P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, both the MDR1 and VEGF mRNA decreased in a dose-dependent manner following 48 hours of treatment of octreotide (P < 0.05). The results of western blot showed that octreotide decreased the expressions of SSTR2, MDR1, and VEGF protein in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Octreotide significantly inhibits ovarian cancer's proliferation and promotes its apoptosis via the cell surface expression of SSTR2. It could be used as a new targeted drug for treatment of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer. The main reason for the high mortality among ovarian cancer patients is the development of drug resistance. The expression of collagen genes by cancer cells can increase drug resistance by inhibiting the penetration of the drug into the cancer tissue as well as increase apoptosis resistance. In this study, we present data that shows differential expression levels of collagen genes and proteins in cisplatin- (CIS), paclitaxel- (PAC), doxorubicin- (DOX), topotecan- (TOP), vincristine- (VIN) and methotrexate- (MTX) resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed to determine the mRNA levels. Protein expression was detected using Western blot and immunocytochemistry assays. In the drug resistant cell lines, we observed the upregulation of eight collagen genes at the mRNA level and based on these expression levels, we divided the collagen genes into the following three groups: 1. Genes with less than a 50-fold increase in expression: COL1A1, COL5A2, COL12A1 and COL17A1. 2. Genes with greater than a 50-fold increase in expression: COL1A2, COL15A1 and COL21A1. 3. Gene with a very high level of expression: COL3A1. Expression of collagen (COL) proteins from groups 2 and 3 were also confirmed using immunocytochemistry. Western blot analysis showed very high expression levels of COL3A1 protein, and immunocytochemistry analysis showed the presence of extracellular COL3A1 in the W1TR cell line. The cells mainly responsible for the extracellular COL3A1 production are aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1) positive cells. All correlations between the types of cytostatic drugs and the expression levels of different COL genes were studied, and our results suggest that the expression of fibrillar collagens may be involved in the TOP and PAC resistance of the ovarian cancer cells. The expression pattern of COL genes provide a preliminary view into the role of these proteins in cytostatic drug resistance of cancer cells. The exact role of these COL genes in drug resistance requires further investigation.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab combined with Albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy for patients with platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic ovarian cancer. METHOD(S): A total of 58 patients were confirmed ovarian cancer by surgery during September 2010 to October 2013, these patients had postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with platinum-based regimens and they were stable disease during the chemotherapy but had recurrence within six months. The 58 patients were separated into two groups, 28 patients received Bevacizumab combined with albumin bound paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen(combined group), ab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 days cycle with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 15.The other 30 patients received ab-paclitaxel only 100mg/m2on days 1, 8 and 15(single group) of a 28 days cycle, The adverse reactions and efficacy were evaluated after treatment. The patients were followed-up, and the survival was analyzed. RESULT(S): The objective response rates of combined group and single group were respectively 53.57%(15/28) and 36.67%(11/30)(P=0.025, chi2=3.425). The median progression-free survival was 8.9 months and 6.6 months(chi2=11.892, P=0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months and 15.6 months (chi2=5.376, P=0.02). The specific toxicities of combined group was hypertension(14.28%), haemorrhage (10.71%), proteinuria(10.71%) within I-II grade, these adverse reactions could be controlled after medication. The most frequent adverse reactions of the both groups were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, the grade III-IV myelosuppression occurred in the two groups, but it had no statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): Bevacizumab with Ab-paclitaxel has antitumor activity with manageable side effects in patients with platinum resistant recurrent or metastatic ovarian carcinoma, and it can prolong survival time compared with the single group, This regimen has good clinical application prospects.Copyright © 2016, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Cancer Prevention and Treatment.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is recommended as a first-line chemotherapeutic agent against ovarian cancer, but drug resistance becomes a major limitation of its success clinically. The key molecule or mechanism associated with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer still remains unclear. Sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is of vital importance in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SOX2 in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis and paclitaxel resistance. In the present study, the expression of SOX2 was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR in 40 clinical samples and in SKOV3 cells and SKOV3/TAX cells (paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line). The effects of SOX2 knockdown on ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were also studied. The IHC and real-time PCR results showed that the difference of SOX2 expression between ovarian cancer and the adjacent non-tumorous ovarian tissues was statistically significant. Western blot analysis revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was inhibited in cells overexpressing SOX2. Western blot analysis showed that the SOX2 protein was overexpressed in paclitaxel-resistant cells and weakly detectable in paclitaxel-sensitive cells. SOX2 silencing significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in SKOV3-TR with SOX2 knockdown compared to SKOV3-TR transfected with control small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our work indicates SOX2 will become both a rational indicator of ovarian cancer prognosis and a promising target for ovarian cancer gene therapy.Copyright © 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

N2  -  MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that function as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miR-148a has been suggested to be associated with human ovarian cancer, however, the detailed functions of miR-148a in ovarian cancer remain to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of miR-148a in ovarian cancer cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were conducted to examine the RNA and protein levels, respectively. The luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the target relationship. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were additionally conducted. The present study demonstrated that miR-148a inhibited cell proliferation and promoted the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3 (PDIA3) was identified as a target gene of miR-148a. A fluorescent reporter assay was performed to confirm that miR-148a was able to directly bind to the 3'-untranslated region of PDIA3 mRNA. In addition, miR-148a was frequently downregulated in ovarian cancer tissue, whereas the expression levels of PDIA3 were increased. Knockdown of PDIA3 significantly inhibited the proliferation and promoted the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of the ovarian cancer cells, whereas overexpression of PDIA3 had the opposite effects. Therefore, the results of the present study suggested that miR-148a inhibited the proliferation and promoted the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells, and this may be partly attributed to direct targeting of PDIA3.

N2  -  Introduction: The classical taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), the newer taxane cabazitaxel and the nanoparticle-bound nab-paclitaxel are among the most widely used anticancer drugs. Despite years of research, the optimal dosing regimen (weekly vs 3-weekly) and optimal dose is still controversial, as is the value of pharmacological personalization of taxane dosing.Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the pharmacological properties of the taxanes, including metabolism, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and aspects in the clinical use of taxanes. The latter includes the ongoing debate on the most active and safe regimen (paclitaxel, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel), the recommended initial dose (cabazitaxel) and pharmacological dosing individualization.Expert opinion: Taxanes share the characteristics of extensive hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion, the need for dose adaptation in patients with liver dysfunction, and substantial pharmacokinetic variability even after taking into account known covariates. Data from clinical studies suggest that optimal scheduling of the taxanes is dependent not only on the specific taxane compound, but also on the tumor type and line of treatment. Finally, treating oncologists should be aware of the substantial risk for drug-drug interactions that is a direct consequence of the complex hepatic metabolism of the taxanes.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.

N2  -  There is growing recognition of the important role of metronomic chemotherapy in cancer treatment. On the basis of their unique antiangiogenic effects, we tested the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel, which stimulates thrombospondin-1, and topotecan, which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1-a, at metronomic dosing for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. In vitro and in vivo SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR (taxane-resistant) orthotopic models were used to examine the effects of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. We examined cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (microvessel density, MVD) in tumors obtained at necropsy. In vivo therapy experiments demonstrated treatment with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and in combination with metronomic topotecan resulted in significant reductions in tumor weight (62% in the SKOV3ip1 model, P < 0.01 and 96% in the HeyA8 model, P < 0.03) compared with vehicle (P < 0.01). In the HeyA8-MDR model, metronomic monotherapy with either cytotoxic agent had modest effects on tumor growth, but combination therapy decreased tumor burden by 61% compared with vehicle (P < 0.03). The greatest reduction in MVD (P < 0.05) and proliferation was seen in combination metronomic therapy groups. Combination metronomic therapy resulted in prolonged overall survival in vivo compared with other groups (P < 0.001). Tube formation was significantly inhibited in RF-24 endothelial cells exposed to media conditioned with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and media conditioned with combination metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. The combination of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan offers a novel, highly effective therapeutic approach for ovarian carcinoma that merits further clinical development.Copyright © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  We propose CHI3L1 as a prognostic biomarker for patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and also suggest possible biological functions of CHI3L1. We measured CHI3L1 expression with quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 180 women with EOC and evaluated correlations between CHI3L1 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and the outcomes of the patients. The expression of CHI3L1 was higher in cancerous tissues than in normal tissues. The expression of CHI3L1 was also higher in patients with a serous histological type, advanced stage, and chemoresistance. Patients with high CHI3L1 expression had a shorter progressionfree survival (p < 0.001)and overall survival (p < 0.001). Patients with high CHI3L1 expression also had a high risk of recurrence (p < 0.001)and death (p < 0.001). In vitro studies showed that CHI3L1 up-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein and hampered paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that CHI3L1 shows potential as a prognostic biomarker for EOC. CHI3L1 may promote chemoresistance via inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis by up-regulating Mcl-1.

N2  -  BACKGROUND The optimal weekly oral dose of sirolimus and intravenous nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) were evaluated. METHODS A phase 1b study was performed to evaluate escalating doses of oral sirolimus (5-60 mg) on days 2, 9, and 16 with intravenous nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. A run-in treatment of nab-paclitaxel (day -14) and sirolimus (day -7) was administered for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments. Clinical trial endpoints included dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated doses, and response rates. Pharmacodynamics included immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homolog, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AKT, phosphorylated AKT, S6K1, and phosphorylated S6K1; exploratory gene expression analysis; and [18F]fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography. RESULTS Twenty-three patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. Fifteen patients had prior taxane therapy. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for responses. One patient had a complete response, and 5 patients had a partial response (3 confirmed). DLTs were seen in 1 patient each at 10 (grade 3 dyspnea/hypoxia) and 40 mg (grade 4 leukopenia/neutropenia) and in 2 patients at 60 mg (grade 3 fatigue and grade 4 pericardial effusion). Patients with higher expression of posttreatment AKT and a greater decline in FDG activity were more likely to have a treatment response or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS Sirolimus showed an acceptable safety profile at a weekly dose of 40 mg with weekly intravenous nab-paclitaxel at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. The posttreatment AKT score and changes in FDG activity may have roles as early predictors of responses to mTOR inhibitors.Copyright © 2015 American Cancer Society.

N2  -  Taxanes (a class of chemotherapeutic agents) are an important cause of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) in cancer patients. During the last decade, the development of rapid drug desensitization has been key to allow patients with HSRs to taxanes to be safely re-treated although the mechanisms of these HSRs are not fully understood. Earlier studies suggested that solvents, such as Cremophor EL used to solubilize paclitaxel, were responsible for HSRs through complement activation, but recent findings have raised the possibility that some of these HSRs are IgE-mediated. Taxane skin testing, which identifies patients with an IgE-mediated sensitivity, appears as a promising diagnostic and risk stratification tool in the management of patients with HSRs to taxanes. The management of patients following a HSR involves risk stratification and re-exposure could be performed either through rapid drug desensitization or graded challenge based on the severity of the initial HSR and the skin test result. Rapid drug desensitization has been shown to be an effective and safe method to re-introduce taxanes in hundreds of patients, including those with life-threatening HSRs. Patients with non-severe delayed skin HSRs may benefit from rapid drug desensitization since they may be at increased risk for an immediate HSR upon re-exposure. This review focuses on the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and novel mechanisms of immediate HSRs to taxanes. A new management strategy for HSRs to taxanes based on skin testing and rapid drug desensitization is proposed.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  -  Albumin nanoparticles are one of the most important drug carriers for the delivery of therapeutic drugs, especially for the treatment of malignancies. This potential is due to their high binding capacity for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs and the possibility of surface modification. Accumulation of albumin-bound drugs in the tumor interstitium occurs by the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which is also facilitated by the 60-kDa glycoprotein transcytosis pathway and binding to secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine located in the tumor extracellular matrix. In addition, specific ligands such as monoclonal antibodies, folic acid, transferrin, and peptides can be conjugated to the surface of albumin nanoparticles to actively target the drug to its site of action. The albumin-bound paclitaxel, Abraxane, is one of the several therapeutic nanocarriers that have been approved for clinical use. By the development of Abraxane that demonstrates a higher response rate and improved tolerability and therapeutic efficiency in comparison with solvent-based formulation, and with consideration of its commercial success, albumin is attracting the interest of many biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies. This chapter explores the current targeted and nontargeted albumin-based nanoparticles that are in various stages of development for the delivery of therapeutic agents in order to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Purpose: The Notch pathway plays an important role in both stem cell biology and cancer. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been reported in several human tumor types. In this report, we describe the development of an antibody, OMP-59R5 (tarextumab), which blocks both Notch2 and Notch3 signaling. Experimental Design: We utilized patient-derived xenograft tumors to evaluate antitumor effect of OMP-59R5. Immunohistochemistry, RNA microarray, real-Time PCR, and in vivo serial transplantation assays were employed to investigate the mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic readouts. Result(s): Wefound that anti-Notch2/3, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents was efficacious in a broad spectrum of epithelial tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Notably, the sensitivity of anti-Notch2/3 in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic tumors was associated with higher levels of Notch3 gene expression. The antitumor effect of anti-Notch2/3 in combination with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was greater than the combination effect with gemcitabine alone. OMP-59R5 inhibits both human and mouse Notch2 and Notch3 function and its antitumor activity was characterized by a dual mechanism of action in both tumor and stromal/vascular cells in xenograft experiments. In tumorcells, anti-Notch2/3 inhibited expression of Notch target genes and reduced tumor-initiating cell frequency. In the tumor stroma, OMP-59R5 consistently inhibited the expression of Notch3, HeyL, and Rgs5, characteristic of affecting pericyte function in tumor vasculature. Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that blockade of Notch2/3 signaling with this cross-reactive antagonist antibody may be an effective strategy for treatment of a variety of tumor types.Copyright © 2015 AACR.

N2  -  Purpose of review Recent advances in nanotechnology have addressed some of the issues related to lack of selectivity and nonspecific toxicities associated with conventional chemotherapy. Nanoparticles are therapeutic carriers that can be fine tuned for specific application and for passive or active tumor targeting. Recent findings Although the nanoparticle field is rapidly expanding, there are to date only six nanoparticle-based drug delivery platforms and two antibody-drug conjugates that are clinically approved for cancer therapy. Here, we review the clinical data of liposomal anthracyclines, nanoparticle formulations of paclitaxel and trastuzumab emtansine. We then briefly comment on efficacy and safety issues of nanoparticles, as well as on the next-generation nanoparticles for cancer therapy. Summary The emerging development of cancer nanotechnology offers the opportunity of reinvestigating the potential of cytotoxic agents, improving tumor targeting and drug delivery, leading to better safety profile and antitumor activity. Adding specificity to nanoparticles may allow personalization of cancer therapy using chemotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel that was initially developed more than a decade ago to overcome toxicities associated with the solvents used in the formulation of standard paclitaxel and to potentially improve efficacy. Nab-paclitaxel has demonstrated an advantage over solvent-based paclitaxel by being able to deliver a higher dose of paclitaxel to tumors and decrease the incidence of serious toxicities, including severe allergic reactions. To date, nab-paclitaxel has been indicated for the treatment of three solid tumors in the USA. It was first approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in 2005, followed by locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer in 2012, and most recently for metastatic pancreatic cancer in 2013. Nab-paclitaxel is also under investigation for the treatment of a number of other solid tumors. This review highlights key clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of nab-paclitaxel in the solid tumors for which it is currently indicated, discusses ongoing trials that may provide new data for the expansion of nab-paclitaxel's indications into other solid tumors, and provides a clinical perspective on the use of nab-paclitaxel in practice.Copyright © 2015 Kundranda and Niu.

N2  -  Purpose: Zoledronic acid is being increasingly recognized for its antitumor properties, but the underlying functions are not well understood. In this study, we hypothesized that zoledronic acid inhibits ovarian cancer angiogenesis preventing Rac1 activation. Experimental Design: The biologic effects of zoledronic acid were examined using a series of in vitro [cell invasion, cytokine production, Rac1 activation, reverse-phase protein array, and in vivo (orthotopic mouse models)] experiments. Result(s): There was significant inhibition of ovarian cancer (HeyA8-MDR and OVCAR-5) cell invasion as well as reduced production of proangiogenic cytokines in response to zoledronic acid treatment. Furthermore, zoledronic acid inactivated Rac1 and decreased the levels of Pak1/p38/matrix metalloproteinase-2 in ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, zoledronic acid reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation and inactivated Rac1 in both HeyA8-MDR and OVCAR-5 models. These in vivo antitumor effects were enhanced in both models when zoledronic acid was combined with nab-paclitaxel. Conclusion(s): Zoledronic acid has robust antitumor and antiangiogenic activity and merits further clinical development as ovarian cancer treatment.Copyright © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  A majority of high-grade (HG) serous ovarian cancer (SOC) patients develop resistant disease despite high initial response rates to platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. We identified shed/secreted proteins in preclinical models of paclitaxel-resistant human HGSOC models and correlated these candidate proteins with patient outcomes using public data from HGSOC patients. Proteomic analyses of a HGSOC cell line secretome was compared to those from a syngeneic paclitaxel-resistant variant and from a line established from an intrinsically chemorefractory HGSOC patient. Associations between the identified candidate proteins and patient outcome were assessed in a discovery cohort of 545 patients and two validation cohorts totaling 795 independent SOC patients. Among the 81 differentially abundant proteins identified (q < 0.05) from paclitaxel-sensitive vs -resistant HGSOC cell secretomes, AKAP12 was verified to be elevated in all models of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC. Furthermore, elevated AKAP12 transcript expression was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival. Associations with outcome were observed in three independent cohorts and remained significant after adjusted multivariate modeling. We further provide evidence to support that differential gene methylation status is associated with elevated expression of AKAP12 in taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer patient subsets. Elevated expression and shedding/secretion of AKAP12 is characteristic of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC cells, and elevated AKAP12 transcript expression is a poor prognostic and predictive marker for progression-free and overall survival in SOC patients.Copyright © 2015 American Chemical Society.

N2  -  Taxol remained as the mainstay therapeutic agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer, however recurrence rate is still high. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subset of cells in the bulk of tumors and play a central role in inducing drug resistance and recurrence. Furthermore, cancer metabolism has been an area under intensive investigation, since accumulating evidence has shown that CSCs and cancer metabolism are closely linked, an effect named as metabolic reprogramming. In this work, we aimed to investigate the impacts of a novel liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel (Nano-Taxol) on the stemness phenotype and metabolic reprogramming. A paclitaxel-resis-tant cell line (TR) was established at frst. Tumor growth was induced in the mice peritoneal cavity by inoculation of TR cells. A 2x2 factorial experiment was designed to test the therapeutic efficacy in which factor 1 represented the comparison of drugs (Taxol versus Nano-Taxol), while factor 2 represented the delivery route (intravenous versus intraperitoneal delivery). In this work, we found that intraperitoneal delivery of Nano-Taxol redirects metabolic reprogramming, from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, and effectively suppresses cancer stem cells. Also, intraperitoneal delivery of Nano-Taxol led to a significantly better control of tumor growth compared with intravenous delivery of Taxol (current standard treatment). This translational research may serve as a novel pathway for the drug development of nanomedicine. In the future, this treatment modality may be extended to treat several relevant cancers that have been proved to be suitable for the loco-regional delivery of therapeutic agents, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

N2  -  Introduction: The polymeric albumin-free micellar formulation of paclitaxel, CynviloqTM, is being developed as the next generation nanoparticle paclitaxel for treatment of solid tumor indications. Using albumin-bound nab-paclitaxel (nab-PTX) as comparator in in vitro dissolution and mouse PK studies, we recently reported a 10-fold higher nanoparticle stability in serum-free media and a 10-fold increased peritoneal paclitaxel levels for Cynviloq vs. nab-PTX as early as 1 hour post IP administration at 30 mg/kg. Moreover, since antitumor efficacy of nab-PTX after IV and IP administrations was recently shown to be equivalent in a peritoneal metastatic gastric cancer model, we set out to compare the efficacy of IV nab-PTX vs. IP Cynviloq in a peritoneal metastatic model of ovarian cancer. Method(s): Five to six-weeks old athymic female nu+/nu+ mice were injected IP with 2x106 IGROV1 human ovarian cancer cells/100 muL saline. Mice were randomized into five experimental groups and one saline control group (n = 10-13) 7 days post tumor inoculation with the day of injection assigned as Day 0. nab-PTX was administered IV at 15 or 30 mg/kg, whereas Cynviloq was administered IP at 15, 30 and 60 mg/kg/day according to a qdx5 dosing regimen. Tumor-bearing mice were monitored twice weekly up to 12 weeks for weight loss and girth increase. Study endpoints included quantification of intraperitoneal tumor nodule size and number of nodules, incidence and volume of collected ascites as well as overall survival. Statistical analyses performed included Chi square test, ANOVA and unpaired Student's t-test. Result(s): Treatments with either IP Cynviloq or IV nab-PTX were well tolerated and significantly (P<0.05) increased the median survival of mice compared to untreated controls. However, analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that IP Cynviloq treatments conferred significant survival advantage over IV nab-PTX at 15 and 30 mg/kg doses (P = 0.0011 and 0.0387, respectively). Cynviloq-treated cohorts also displayed significant (P = 0.0057) dose-dependent survival advantage relative to the nab-PTX-treated cohorts (P = 0.0454). Consistent with these findings, mice treated with 15 and 30 mg/kg IP Cynviloq showed significantly decreased intraperitoneal tumor burden scores (P = 0.014 and 0.025, respectively). However, significant decreases in ascitic fluid volumes were only observed in mice treated with 15 mg/kg IP Cynviloq (P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): Collectively, our data strongly supports the notion that compared to IV-administered nab-PTX, IP delivery of Cynviloq results in improved efficacy without any additional toxicity in a metastatic model of ovarian cancer. Hence, further development of IP-administered Cynviloq in the treatment of indications with malignant ascites, including ovarian and gastric cancers, are therefore warranted.

N2  -  Objective: Although most ovarian cancer patients respond initially to the standard of care involving carboplatinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, the majority will recur with chemotherapeutically resistant disease. Unfortunately, no clinical biomarker(s) for predicting or monitoring chemotherapeutic resistance are available. We sought to identify shed and/or secreted proteins from paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cells and identify whether any of these correlate with ovarian cancer patient outcome. Method(s): A proteomic analysis of secretomes from high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells (OV90) was compared to that from a syngeneic paclitaxel-resistant variant (OV90-TR) and a cancer cell line developed from a chemorefractory HGSOC patient. Associations between the identified candidates and patient outcome were assessed from publicly available transcript expression data (n = 545 ovarian cancer patients) and validated independently (n = 795 ovarian cancer patients). Result(s): Among the 81 differentially abundant proteins identified (q<0.05) from paclitaxel-sensitive vs -resistant HGSOC cell secretomes, AKAP12 was verified to be elevated at the protein and transcript level in all models of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC. Further, elevated AKAP12 transcript expression was found to significantly correlate with poor progression-free (Hazard Ratio = 1.487 (+/- 0.148), p = 0.0085 (+/- 0.002) and overall (Hazard Ratio = 1.22 (+/- 0.08), p = 0.009 (+/- 0.013) survival. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that elevation and efflux of AKAP12 is characteristic of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC cells and that elevated AKAP12 expression correlates with poor ovarian cancer patient survival.

N2  -  The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which signals through the Frizzled (FZD) receptor family and several co-receptors, has long been implicated in cancer. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by vantictumab (anti-Fzd7, OMP-18R5) or ipafricept (FZD8-Fc, OMP-54F28) inhibits tumor growth, decreases tumorigenicity and induces differentiation in solid tumors. The anti-tumor effect of our Wnt antagonists is most evident in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We sought to determine if the anti-tumor effect of Wnt pathway inhibitors varied with different chemotherapeutic agents. We compared the growth inhibitory effect of vantictumab and ipafricept with either taxanes (paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel) or with DNA synthesis inhibitors (gemcitabine and carboplatin) in patient-derived tumor xenografts. We observed enhanced anti-tumor activity when combining vantictumab or ipafricept with nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel compared to the combination with gemcitabine or carboplatin in pancreatic ductal carcinoma and serous ovarian cancer xenograft models. Histologic analysis in a pancreatic ductal carcinoma indicated that nab-paclitaxel increased mitotic cells and beta-catenin levels. Importantly, the addition of vantictumab to nab-paclitaxel reversed the nab-paclitaxel-induced increase in mitotic cells and beta-catenin expression. A potential mechanism to account for these results involves the observation that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is under cell cycle control and peaks at the G2/M phase. Taxanes inhibit microtubule function and block the cell cycle at G2/M. In contrast, other chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum compounds and nucleoside analogs, inhibit DNA synthesis and block cell proliferation at S phase. Our findings suggest that combination of Wnt blockade with chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxanes, that induce G2/M arrest may resulted in enhanced anti-tumor activity. The optimal synergy of anti-Wnt plus taxane combination occurs when the antibody was applied prior to taxane. Further analyses in serous ovarian tumors reveal that pre-treatment with ipafricept resulted in dysregulated beta-cetenin localization within giant multi-nucleated cells and up-regulation of genes associated with negative regulators of G1 progression. Our work provides evidence for the enhanced anti-tumor effect of Wnt pathway inhibitors in combination with taxanes and highlights the importance of preclinical examination to identify the most efficacious combination therapy regimens and the timing of antibody action for Wnt antagonists in combination with taxanes for optimal treatment efficacy.

N2  -  Background: Antitumor immune responses in ovarian cancer have been associated with prolonged survival. In addition to direct cytotoxic activity, chemotherapies can also possess immunomodulatory properties. Paclitaxel may enhance metastasis and drug resistance by signaling via the TLR4 pathway. GMCSF has been shown to induce the generation of myeloid dendritic cells and enhance antigen presentation. We hypothesized that weekly nabpaclitaxel followed by GMCSF may enhance overall antitumor immunity. Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated by flow cytometry for circulating monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, Tlymphocytes, and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Elispot assays for interferon gamma were performed on PBMC to identify immunity against ovarian cancer antigens. Result(s): Twentyone patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer enrolled after receiving an average of 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. 52% had previously received bevacizumab. Median OS was 16.8 months. Mean time to progression was 5.5 months for those patients who achieved a CR and 4.5 months for those who did not. Overall response rate was 71% (29% CR, 43% PR). Interferon gamma Elispot responses at mean followup timepoints against insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) correlated with time to progression (r = 0.723, p = 0.0035). The fold change achieved above baseline Elispot responses against IGF1R (r = 0.827, p = 0.0003) also correlated with time to progression. Levels of MDSC at time of study enrollment were associated with achieving a complete response to treatment (p = 0.0544). Conclusion(s): Our results show activity of this regimen and immune correlates for response have been identified. Rational combinations of immune modulators with cytotoxic chemotherapies should be investigated further for platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer with a focus on identifying immunologic synergies and those patients most likely to respond through immune biomarkers.

N2  -  We present a rare case of taxane-pretreated metastatic gastric cancer with an excellent response to nab-paclitaxel. A 66- year-old woman was diagnosed with Stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma (T4aN3M1[LYM, OTH]P1CY1). She failed to respond to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens including S-1, capecitabine, cisplatin, L-OHP, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and CPT- 11. Finally, 6th line chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel was tried. After 4 courses of nab-paclitaxel, a CT scan revealed decreasing ascites and a reduction in the size of the ovary metastasis. She experienced a clinical response for about 4 months. The adverse events were only Grade 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy and joint pain, and her performance status improved during the treatment period.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a type of molecular chaperone. It is a possible candidate protein that contributes to development of drug resistance. We first examined the involvement of GRP78 in chemotherapy-resistance in human ovarian cancer cell., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of GRP78 mRNA and protein were examined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively, in human ovarian cancer cells line (HO-8910). Sensitivity of HO-8910 to paclitaxel was determined with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). Suppression of GRP78 expression was performed using specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in HO-8910 cells, and cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 statistical package., RESULTS: HO-8910 cells, with high basal levels of GRP78, exhibited low sensitivity to paclitaxel. The mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 were dramatically decreased at 24h, 48h and 72h after transfection and the sensitivity to paclitaxel was increased when the GRP78 gene was disturbed by specific siRNA transfection., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that high GRP78 expression might be one of the molecular mechanisms causing resistance to paclitaxel, and therefore siRNA of GRP78 may be useful in tumor-specific gene therapy for ovarian cancer.

N2  -  The application of nanotechnology in oncology has increased the efficacy and efficiency of some cytotoxic agents. The paradigm in this field is nab-paclitaxel, a soluble form of paclitaxel that is linked to albumin nanoparticles. The development of nanotechnology as a delivery system for paclitaxel has provided better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, neutralizing its hydrophobicity. This procedure significantly improves the treatment of metastatic breast cancer compared to conventional paclitaxel-based therapies, including other type of cancers such as metastatic pancreatic cancer, stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic melanoma. In these last cases, significant differences were found in primary end-points for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel-based chemotherapy compared to those treated with conventional treatments. The application of nanotechnology in cancer treatment may also improve the efficacy of other known drugs, as a result of improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, similarly to paclitaxel.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  Background. Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women and causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive cancer. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is known to increase intratumoral concentration of the paclitaxel by a receptor-mediated transport process across the endothelial cell wall, thereby breaching the blood/tumor interface. We present below three cases in which nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy has been used in different settings for patients with ovarian cancer. Case Presentation. In the first case nab-paclitaxel was used along with carboplatin in adjuvant setting, in the second case, nab-paclitaxel was used along with carboplatin and bevacizumab as second line chemotherapy in a relapsed ovarian cancer case, and the third case delineates the use of nab-paclitaxel along with cisplatin as third line chemotherapy. Conclusion. In all the three scenarios, patients tolerated the chemotherapy well, as well as responding well to nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy. The patients are currently on long-term follow-up and have been having an uneventful postchemotherapy. © 2014 K. N Srinivasan et al.

N2  -  Purpose: Cisplatin and its platinum derivatives are first-line chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however, treatment is associated with tumor resistance and significant toxicity. Here we investigated the antitumoral activity of lipoplatin, one of the most promising liposomal platinum drug formulations under clinical investigation. Experimental Design: In vitro effects of lipoplatin were tested on a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, sensitive and resistant to cisplatin, using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell models. We evaluated in vivo the lipoplatin anticancer activity using tumor xenografts. Result(s): Lipoplatin exhibited a potent antitumoral activity in all ovarian cancer cell lines tested, induced apoptosis, and activated caspase-9, -8, and -3, downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax. Lipoplatin inhibited thioredoxin reductase enzymatic activity and increased reactive oxygen species accumulation and reduced EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and inhibited cell invasion. Lipoplatin demonstrated a synergistic effect when used in combination with doxorubicin, widely used in relapsed ovarian cancer treatment, and with the albumin-bound paclitaxel, Abraxane. Lipoplatin decreased both ALDH and CD133 expression, markers of ovarian cancer stem cells. Multicellular aggregates/spheroids are present in ascites of patients and most contribute to the spreading to secondary sites. Lipoplatin decreased spheroids growth, vitality, and cell migration out of preformed spheroids. Finally, lipoplatin inhibited more than 90% tumor xenograft growth with minimal systemic toxicity, and after the treatment suspension, no tumor progression was observed. Conclusion(s): These preclinical data suggest that lipoplatin has potential for clinical assessment in aggressive cisplatin-resistant patients with ovarian cancer.Copyright ©2014 AACR.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies due to high chemoresistance to the combination of platinum with taxane. Immunotherapy against ovarian cancer is a promising strategy to develop from animal-based cancer research. We investigated changes in the immunogenicity of paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells following exposure to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Murine ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) showed some resistance to paclitaxel, a first-line therapy for ovarian cancer. However, MOSECs pre-exposed to paclitaxel died through apoptosis after incubation with doxorubicin or cisplatin for 2 h. Injected into mice, the paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs post-treated with doxorubicin induced more MOSEC-specific CD4+ T cells and extended survival for a greater time than MOSECs treated with paclitaxel alone; and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and produced IL-12 after co-culture with paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin. We also observed that in paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, the expression of MyD88 and related target proteins decreased compared to paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs only, while in BMDCs co-cultured with these MOSECs the expression of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) increased. These findings suggest that paclitaxel pre-exposed cancer cells treated with doxorubicin can induce significant apoptosis and a therapeutic antitumor immune response in advanced ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX), a taxane plant product, is one of the most effective broad-spectrum anti-cancer agents and approved for the treatment of a variety of cancers including ovarian, breast, lung, head and neck as well as Kaposi's sarcoma. Poor aqueous solubility and serious side effects associated with commercial preparation of PTX (Taxol) triggered the development of alternative PTX formulations. Over past three decades, plethora of research work has been published towards the development of cremophor free and efficient formulations. Various nanocarrier systems including nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, bioconjugates and dendrimers have been employed in order to improve PTX solubility and eliminate undesired side effects. These nanocarriers offer the advantage of high degree of encapsulation and cellular uptake, escape from elimination by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux, and can be explored for targeted drug delivery. The potential of these nanocarriers is reflected by the fact that various nanocarriers of PTX are in different stages of clinical trials and a few have already been commercialized including Abraxane, Lipusu and Genexol PM. This review focuses on the various challenges associated with PTX formulation development, limitations of existing formulations and novel approaches for the development of alternative formulations for PTX and also highlights the development of novel formulations in clinical settings.Copyright © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  -  Background: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a member of the hydroxamic acid class of the newly developed histone deacetylase inhibitors. Recently, Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has attracted increasing attention because of its antitumor activity and synergistic effects in combination with a variety of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. Paclitaxel (PTX), is a natural anticancer drugs; however, resistance to paclitaxel has become a major challenge to the efficacy of this agent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined application of these two drugs on the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cell line. Method(s): In the present study, the effects of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or/and paclitaxel on OC3/P cells cultured in vitro were analyzed in terms of cell viability, migration, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis by CCK-8, wound healing and flow cytometry assays. Changes in cell ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression of genes and proteins related to proliferation, apoptosis and drug resistance were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Result(s): There was no cross-resistance of the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cells to Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid combined with paclitaxel significantly inhibited cell growth and reduced the migration of OC3/P cells compared with the effects of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or paclitaxel alone. Q-PCR showed the combination of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and paclitaxel reduced intracellular bcl-2 and c-myc gene expression and increased bax gene expression more distinctly than the application of SAHA or paclitaxel alone. Moreover, the level of mdr1 gene expression in cells treated with Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid was lower than that of the control group (P <0.05). Western blot analysis showed that Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid alone or in combination with paclitaxel enhanced caspase-3 protein expression and degraded ID1 protein expression in OC3/P cells. Conclusion(s): Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid inhibited the growth of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cells and reduced migration by the induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. These observations indicate the possible synergistic antitumor effects of sequential Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and paclitaxel treatment.Copyright © 2014 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  -  ab-Paclitaxel, the first approved drug with a nanoparticle-based formulation, reveals major advantages. It allows the administration of higher dosages and improved bioavailability of paclitaxel but without an increased risk of severe adverse events. By eliminating Cremophor EL and exploiting albumin receptor-mediated transport, the drug can accumulate at higher concentrations in selected tumor tissues. In practical terms, the nanoparticle-based formulation also shows advantages compared to the surfactant-based formulation. Over the last years, the availability of nab-paclitaxel has extended the treatment options for metastatic breast cancer resulting in several dosing regimens that can be adopted in clinical practice. Importantly, nab-paclitaxel now facilitates the extension of taxanes' therapeutic indications because it has been also approved for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Here, synergy between nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine is meant to result in an enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, which has not been considered important for paclitaxel until now. Current research aims at identifying the therapeutic significance of nab-paclitaxel for various treatment concepts and additional indications, such as malignant melanoma, ovarian cancer as well as head and neck cancers. © Deutscher Apotheker Verlag.

N2  -  Introduction: IG-001 (Genexol-PM), utilizes biodegradable di-block copolymers composed of methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactide) to form micellar nanoparticles with paclitaxel containing a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic shell and is being developed as the next generation nanoparticle paclitaxel. Its target indications are solid tumors such as Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC), Lung, Ovarian, Bladder, Pancreatic and Melanoma. Herein, we have provided the results of clinical experience with IG-001 in MBC available to date through summaries of two completed Phase 2 studies, an ongoing Phase 3 study and a completed post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study. Result(s): Results of the two completed safety and efficacy single-arm Phase 2 studies revealed ORRs of 28.1% and 58.5% in anthracyclin-resistant MBC patients and those with histologically-confirmed MBC, respectively. The interim analysis of an ongoing dual-arm Phase 3 data (106 patients/arm) receiving either Taxol (175 mg/m2) or IG-001 (300mg/ m2) over a 3 hour period every 3 weeks for 6 cycles has revealed a superior ORR of IG-001 (40%) vs. Taxol (26%). This superiority over Taxol was very comparable to the historical data from Abraxane trials. Lastly, results of the PMS study of IG-001 in 186 enrolled paients with locally recurrent or MBC showed an overall efficacy rate of 24.32% (36/148 evaluable subjects with partial responses). Twenty one subjects (11.29%) reported a total of 34 serious adverse events. The most frequent were neutropenia (1.61%), febrile neutropenia (1.61%), headache (1.61%), vomiting (1.08%), fever (1.08%), dyspnea (1.08%) and tachycardia (1.08%).Most of these were secondary to expected toxicities of the study drug. Peripheral neuropathy was common but was not dose-limiting in most cases. Hematological toxicities were manageable (3 subjects with febrile neutropenia). Conclusion(s): Taken together, in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with chemotherapy, including anthracycline containing regimens, the efficacy of IG-001 appears to be similar and at least equal to that of Abraxane. Further development of IG-001 is therefore warranted in Breast cancer as well as other solid tumors.

N2  -  Background: Nab-paclitaxel is a novel Cremophor free nanoparticle of albumin-stabilized paclitaxel. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of the nab-paclitaxel in recurrent ovarian cancer patients. Method(s): 17 patients of recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer with platinum and taxane resistance defined by persistent or progressive disease following recurrence within six months of treatment completion and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or elevated CA-125 (>=70 U/mL) in patients without measurable disease. Patients treated with nab-paclitaxel between Jan 2012 to Mar 2014, dose of 260 mg/m2 administered intravenously for 30 minutes on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for six cycles or until disease progression. Result(s): Median age of patients was 62 years; 76% of patients had stage IIIC or IV disease, 82% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and 88% had prior surgery. For assessable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 58% (6 complete responses [CR] and 4 partial responses [PR] among 17 assessable patients). In patients evaluated with RECIST only, the ORR was 44.4% (one CR and three PR of 9 patients). In patients with only elevated CA-125, ORR was 75% (5 CRs and 1 PRs of 8 patients). Median time to response was 1.3 months (range 0.5 to 4.8 months). Estimated median progression-free survival was 8.5 months. The most frequent grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities were neutropenia (35%) and neuropathy (11%). Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel as a single agent in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer seems to be well tolerated and effective in patients who are previously treated with paclitaxel or platins.

N2  -  Objectives: To evaluate the use of nab-paclitaxel in patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal (PP), and fallopian tube carcinomas (CA) in the primary and recurrent setting. Method(s): A single-institution retrospective analysis of women who received nab-paclitaxelwith orwithout any additional cytotoxic agents was performed in patients with ovarian/PP/fallopian tube CA. Response was determined by measurable disease or by assessment of serial CA-125 measurements in both the primary and recurrent setting. Result(s): Nineteen patients were identified; 5 (26%) received nabpaclitaxel in the primary setting and 14 (74%) in the recurrent setting. Most of the patients had a diagnosis of ovarian CA (n =17, 89%), with 1 PP and 1 fallopian tube CA. Of the patients who received nabpaclitaxel in the primary setting, all 5 developed a prior paclitaxel hypersensitivity reaction, 1 in the neoadjuvant setting. All of the primary nab-paclitaxel patients received combination treatment with a platinum (4 carboplatin, 1 cisplatin) for a mean of 5.2 cycles/patient. Four of the 5 patients (80%) had a complete response to treatment, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9 months (range, 0.3-21 months) and median overall survival (OS) of 15 months (range, 2-25 months) noted for the group. Of the 14 patients who received nab-paclitaxel in the recurrent setting, only 1 had had a prior paclitaxel hypersensitivity reaction. Nine patients (64%) were platinum-sensitive and 36% were platinum-resistant. This was a heavily pretreated group, having received a median of 3.5 prior lines of treatment and a median of 4.5 cycles (range, 1-12 cycles) of nab-paclitaxel in the recurrent setting. The majority of patients (9/14 [64%]) received single-agent nab-paclitaxel, 1 received combination treatment with carboplatin and 4with bevacizumab. The overall response ratewas 71% (10/14),with 4 complete responses and 6 partial responses. One patient had stable disease and 3 had progression of disease. Median PFS was 9.2 months and median OS was 57 months. Nab-paclitaxel was well tolerated in this overall group of 19 patients, with neuropathy noted in 2 cases, one ofwhich necessitated changing treatment to docetaxel, and muscle spasms in one additional patient. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel is active in both primary and recurrent ovarian cancer, with an overall response rate of 71% in the recurrent setting and a tolerable toxicity profile.

N2  -  Objectives: There is growing recognition of the important role of metronomic chemotherapy for cancer treatment. Based on their unique antiangiogenic effects, we tested the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP), which stimulates thrombospondin-1, and topotecan, which inhibits hypoxiainducible factor 1-alpha, at metronomic dosing in ovarian carcinoma. Method(s): We examined the effects of ABP and topotecan in vitro (MTT) and in vivo using SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer. We also examined effects on proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and angiogenesis (MVD) in tumor samples obtained at necropsy. Result(s): In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed similar effects (median inhibition concentration [IC50]=20-60 nM) with maximum tolerated dosing (MTD) and metronomic dosing of ABP on HeyA8 tumor cells (P < 0.05). In vivo therapy experiments using the SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 tumor models demonstrated that treatment with metronomic ABP alone and in combination with metronomic topotecan resulted in significant reductions in tumor weight (62% and 96%, respectively) as compared to controls (P < 0.01). Combination treatment with metronomically dosed ABP and topotecan further reduced tumor growth by 82% compared to topotecan alone (P < 0.01). In the chemoresistant tumor model, HeyA8-MDR, metronomically dosed monotherapy with either cytotoxic agent had a modest effect on tumor growth, but combination therapy decreased tumor burden by 74% when compared to controls (P < 0.01). Metronomic ABP monotherapy resulted in reduced cell proliferation (P < 0.001), reduced tumor angiogenesis (P <= 0.01), and increased apoptosis (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Metronomically dosed ABP and topotecan offer a highly effective and novel therapeutic approach in ovarian carcinoma that merits further clinical development.

N2  -  Background: The WNT/FZD signaling pathway is implicated in tumor cell de-differentiation and cancer stem cell (CSC) function in numerous cancer types. As a first-in-class recombinant fusion protein, OMP-54F28 binds WNT ligands and blocks WNT signaling through its domain of an extracellular part of human Frizzled 8 receptor (fused to a human IgG1 Fc fragment). In patient-derived xenograft models, OMP-54F28 inhibits growth and CSC frequency, promotes differentiation of tumor cells, and synergizes with chemotherapy in a broad spectrum of malignancies. Method(s): A 3+3 design was used; OMP-54F28 was given intravenously every 3 weeks. Objectives were determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy. Result(s): 25 patients were treated in 7 dose-escalation cohorts (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg). No further dose escalation was pursued as animal data and PK modeling indicated 10 mg/kg as the target efficacious dose. Most common related Grade 1 and 2 adverse events (AEs; >=20% of patients) were dysgeusia, decreased appetite, fatigue, muscle spasms, nausea, and vomiting. No related Grade >=3 AEs were reported. OMP-54F28 had a half-life of ~4 days at >=10 mg/kg. Consistent with WNT pathway inhibition in bone, 5 patients had doubling from baseline of bone turnover marker beta-C-terminal telopeptide (beta-CTX), an event that was reversible (beta-CTX return to baseline) upon treatment with a single dose of zoledronic acid. PD modulation of WNT pathway genes was shown in hair follicles at >=2.5 mg/kg. Two desmoid tumor patients have experienced stable disease (SD) for >6 months. 4 of 4 patients at 20 mg/kg with >=1 on-study tumor assessment continue on study with SD. Conclusion(s): OMP-54F28 is well tolerated up to 20 mg/kg, double the target efficacious dose. PD modulation in bone and hair follicles was observed. Several patients experienced prolonged SD. Dose escalation is completed, and 3 Phase 1b studies are ongoing (pancreas cancer with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, ovarian cancer with carboplatin and paclitaxel, and hepatocellular cancer with sorafenib). Detailed efficacy, safety, PK and PD results will be presented.

N2  -  Objective: There is growing recognition of the important role of metronomic chemotherapy for cancer treatment. Based on their unique anti-angiogenic effects, we tested the efficacy of dual albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP), which stimulates Thrombospondin-1, and topotecan, which inhibits Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, chemotherapy at metronomic dosing in ovarian carcinoma. Method(s): We examined the effects of ABP and topotecan in vitro (MTT) and in vivo using SKOV3ip1, HeyA8 and HeyA8-MDR orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer. We also examined effects on proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis (TUNEL), and angiogenesis (MVD) in tumor samples obtained at necropsy. Result(s): In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed similar effects (IC50=20-60 nM) of maximum tolerated dosing (MTD) and metronomic dosing of ABP on HeyA8 tumor cells (p<0.05). In vivo therapy experiments using the SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 tumor models demonstrated that treatment with metronomic ABP alone and in combination with metronomic topotecan resulted in significant reductions in tumor weight, 62% and 96% respectively as compared to controls (p<0.01). Combination treatment with metronomically dosed ABP and topotecan further reduced tumor growth by 82% compared to topotecan alone (p<0.01). In the chemoresistant tumor model, HeyA8-MDR, metronomically dosed monotherapy with either cytotoxic agent had a modest effect on tumor growth however, combination therapy decreased tumor burden by 74% when compared to controls (p<0.01). Metronomic ABP monotherapy resulted in reduced cell proliferation (p<0.001), reduced tumor angiogenesis (p<=0.01), and increased apoptosis (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Metronomically-dosed albumin-bound paclitaxel and topotecan offer a highly effective and novel therapeutic approach in ovarian carcinoma that merits further clinical development.

N2  -  Background Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, is a complex and crucial process for tumor growth and development of metastasis. Rac1, a member of the Rho GTPase family, plays a central role in angiogenesis through regulation of endothelial cell migration, tube formation, adhesion, invasion, and proliferation. In this study we hypothesized that zoledronic acid (ZA) inhibits ovarian cancer angiogenesis through the inactivation of Rac1. Methods We treated HeyA8 MDR and Ovcar-5 cells with ZA to assess its effects on cell invasion, proliferation, expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; Milliplex assay) and angiogenic factors. We also determined Rac1 activation by pull-down assay. HeyA8 MDR and Ovcar-5 orthotopic murine models of ovarian cancer were assessed for expression of CD31 and Ki-67, Rac1 activation, and apoptosis by immunohistochemistry after treatment with ZA, nanoparticle, albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), or a combination. Results In vitro, we observed inhibition of HeyA8 MDR and Ovcar-5 cell invasion and proliferation by ZA. Moreover, ZA decreased the secretion of MMP-7 and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) in HeyA8 MDR cells and MMP-9, MMP-10, VEGF-C, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, endothelin-1, follistatin, interleukin-8, placenta growth factor, fibroblast growth factor-1, and hepatocyte growth factor in Ovcar-5 cells. Furthermore, ZA inactivated Rac1 in both cells lines. In vivo, ZA decreased the number of nodules and tumor weight, inhibited angiogenesis and cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis in both HeyA8 MDR and Ovcar-5 animal models. These in vivo antitumor effects were enhanced in both models when ZA was combined with nab-paclitaxel. Conclusion ZA inhibits ovarian cancer angiogenesis through the inactivation of Rac1, suggesting that ZA combined with paclitaxel could be a novel therapeutic approach to ovarian cancer angiogenesis.

N2  -  The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which signals through the Frizzled (FZD) receptor family and several co-receptors, has long been implicated in cancer. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of WNT/beta-catenin signaling by vantictumab (anti-FZD) or OMP-54F28 (FZD8-Fc) inhibits tumor growth, decreases tumorigenicity and induces differentiation in solid tumors. The anti-tumor effect of our Wnt antagonists is most evident in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We sought to determine if the anti-tumor effect of Wnt pathway inhibitors varied with different chemotherapeutic agents. We compared the growth inhibitory effect of vantictumab and OMP-54F28 with either taxanes (paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel) or with DNA synthesis inhibitors (gemcitabine and carboplatin) in patient-derived tumor xenografts. In a model for pancreatic ductal carcinoma, vantictumab with nab-paclitaxel was more efficacious than vantictumab with gemcitabine in inhibiting tumor growth and Wnt target gene expression (at doses of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine that were equivalent in their single-agent growth-inhibitory effects). Histologic analysis indicated that nab-paclitaxel increased mitotic cells and beta-catenin levels. Importantly, the addition of vantictumab to nab-paclitaxel reversed the nab-paclitaxel-induced increase in mitotic cells and beta-catenin expression. An independent experiment in a serous ovarian cancer xenograft model also showed enhanced anti-tumor activity when combining OMP-54F28 with either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel compared to the combination with carboplatin. A potential mechanism to account for these results involves on the observation that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is under cell cycle control and peaks at the G2/M phase. Taxanes inhibit microtubule function and block the cell cycle at G2/M. In contrast, other chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum compounds and nucleoside analogs, inhibit DNA synthesis and block cell proliferation at S phase. We hypothesize that combination of Wnt blockade with chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxanes, that induce G2/M arrest may result in optimal anti-tumor activity.

N2  -  Introduction: nab-paclitaxel-a Cremophor-free, albumin-bound, nanoparticle form of paclitaxel-though a breakthrough in paclitaxel formulation, has inherent problems associated with any biologics. IG-001 (Cynviloq/Genexol-PM), a polymeric albumin-free micellar formulation utilizes biodegradable di-block copolymers composed of methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactide) to form nanoparticles with paclitaxel and is being developed as the next generation nanoparticle paclitaxel. Its target indications are solid tumors such as Breast, NSCLC, Ovarian, Bladder and Pancreatic cancers, taking advantage of its ability to rapidly deliver paclitaxel to the targeted tissue via albumin-mediated transport, as previously described for nab-paclitaxel. Herein, we report preclinical and dissolution stability of IG-001 in comparison to nab-paclitaxel in the ovarian cancer setting. Method(s): Preclinical PK parameters (HL, Tmax, AUCinf, Vz and CL) of the two formulations were compared following bolus IV and IP injections (30 mg/kg) in mice. Blood paclitaxel concentration was quantified using LC/MS/MS method and PK parameters were obtained using the Phoenix PK program (Pharsight, CA). Dissolution studies of nab-paclitaxel and IG-001 were performed using the drug products reconstituted in saline and diluted in PBS or plasma. Particle stability was monitored by dynamic light scattering using the Malvern Nanosizer. Result(s): IG-001 exhibited conditional stability, wherein stability was high in PBS and Lactated Ringer's solution but very low in plasma. In contrast, nab-paclitaxel exhibited the expected instability in both plasma and PBS. Across multiple experiments, there was about a 10-fold enhancement of particle stability in serum-free matrices. This suggests that IG-001 may have a PK advantage over nab-paclitaxel when administered as saline-reconstituted solution into the peritoneal cavity for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Therefore, a PK study was performed in mice with drugs administered IP and IV. The bolus IV injection studies in mice revealed almost identical PK parameters for the two formulations. However, IP injection studies indicated about a 10-fold enhanced paclitaxel levels for IG-001 vs. nab-paclitaxel up to 1 hour post administration. Thereafter, it was not possible to determine IP paclitaxel levels due to complete absorption of the administered drug solution. Conclusion(s): Collectively, our data strongly supports the notion that the conditional stability of IG-001 would confer an advantage in ovarian indication wherein the drug is administered IP as a saline reconstituted drug solution. It also suggests that the observed preferential peritoneal accumulation of paclitaxel when Taxol was administered may not be applicable to nab-paclitaxel due to the absence of Cremophor-EL as a sequestering agent in the peritoneal cavity.

N2  -  Since their addition to paclitaxel in the oncologists' armamentarium in the early 1990s, several new taxane formulations have been developed. Besides docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel, new analogs with better therapeutic profiles are being investigated. The goals of this next generation of taxanes are to improve the toxicity profile and efficacy, and to overcome resistance patterns. Several new taxanes, including cabazitaxel, paclitaxel poliglumex, paclitaxel + endotag, and polymeric-micellar paclitaxel, have shown clinical efficacy. These chemotherapeutics are part of many ongoing phase II and III studies on various cancer types. In addition, there are immunotoxins that link key antibodies to mitotic spindle inhibitors (trastuzumab emtansine and brentuximab vedotin). Through this mechanism, novel formulations increase cytotoxicity, improve specificity, and create possibilities for drug enhancement.Copyright © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health  Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  -  Sensory neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of paclitaxel and also impacts on the use of docetaxel and other taxanes. The cause of this adverse effect has to do with their mechanism of action against microtubules and its interaction with neuronal cytoskeletal components. The variability of this toxicity is defined by several factors including disease type, taxane class, schedule and dose of the specific drug, patient demographics, and use of taxanes in combination regimens (especially with the platinums that are also neurotoxic). Prevention of life-long neuropathy is only produced if the causative drug is halted - treatments to reverse toxicity have shown only minimal improvement. This review investigates trials defining the clinical factors that determine the therapeutic window of taxanes and the enhanced susceptibility to this toxicity. In addition, case vignettes illustrate the range of clinical manifestations of this toxicity during taxane administration. Anti-Cancer Drugs 25:495-501Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  -  Paclitaxel, a known TLR4 ligand, leads to activation of TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway that mediates chemoresistance and tumor progression in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Atractylenolide-I (AO-I), a novel TLR4-antagonizing agent, inhibits TLR4 signaling by interfering with the binding of LPS or paclitaxel to membrane TLR4 of human leukocytes. In this study, AO-I was found to attenuate paclitaxel-induced protein expression of IL-6, VEGF and survivin, and to enhance early apoptosis and growth inhibition in MyD88(+) EOC cells; AO-I was shown to fit into the hydrophobic pocket of human MD-2 and to partially overlap with the binding site of paclitaxel by docking simulations, suggesting that AO-I may block the MD-2-mediated TLR4/MyD88-dependent paclitaxel signaling in MyD88(+) EOC cells. Therefore, AO-I could significantly sensitize the response of MyD88(+) EOC cells to paclitaxel by blocking MD-2-mediated TLR4/MyD88 signaling, and that AO-I-paclitaxel combination could be a promising strategy for the treatment of EOC with a functional TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB- EGF) in paclitaxel- resistant ovarian cancer and elucidate the relationship between HB-EGF and the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel., METHODS: The human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and the paclitaxel- resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780/Taxol were cultured in vitro. Western blot was used to dectect the expression of HB-EGF protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol groups. The A2780 cells were treated with cross- reacting material 197 (CRM197 and A2780 + CRM197 group) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO; A2780 group), while the A2780/Taxol cells were treated with CRM197 (A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group) or DMSO (A2780/Taxol group). The effects of CRM197 on growth and proliferation was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT) and the results were showed as absorbance (A). The effects of CRM197 on cell cycles was tested by flow cytometry, while the effects of CRM197 on apoptosis was examined by caspase- 3 activity assay and the results were showed as p- nitroaniline(pNa). In animal experiment, four groups of cells were inoculated to BALB/c nude mouse subcutaneously to observe tumor formation ability following CRM197 treatment. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of HB-EGF protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol group., CONCLUSIONS: HB-EGF is over-expressed in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer and may be contributes to drug resistance. Inhibition of HB- EGF expression potently enhances apoptosis and inhibit the growth of paclitaxel- resistant ovarian cancer, shedding light on the HB-EGF-targeted therapy options for chemoresistant ovarian cancer patients., RESULTS: The expression level of HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol group (2.11 +/- 0.41) was significantly higher than that of A2780 group (0.75 +/- 0.20; P < 0.01). The inhibition effect of CRM197 on the cell growth of A2780+CRM197 and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was accompanied by the acceleration of CRM197 concentration(P < 0.01). When CRM197>=1 microg/ml, the inhibition effect of CRM197 on the cell growth of A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was significantly higher than that in A2780/Taxol group(P < 0.05). In cell cycle experiment, CRM197 induced the cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in A2780+CRM197 cells[(67 +/- 4)%] compared with A2780 cells[(54 +/- 6)%; P < 0.01], while CRM197 significantly induced the cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 cells [(72 +/- 4)%] compared with A2780/Taxol cells [(24 +/- 8)%; P < 0.01]. CRM197 treatment in A2780+CRM197 group [(40 +/- 6) micromol/L] led to the acceleration of the caspase-3 activity when compared to A2780 group [(6 +/- 6) micromol/L; P < 0.01], while CRM197 treatment in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group [(66 +/- 12) micromol/L] led to significant acceleration of the caspase-3 activity when compared to A2780 group [(9 +/- 6) micromol/L; P < 0.01]. In experiments in vivo, the expression scores of HB- EGF protein in A2780/Taxol tumors (10.8 +/- 3.3) were higher than that in A2780 tumors (5.0 +/- 2.2; P < 0.01). The tumor size and tumor weight of the A2780/Taxol + CRM197 group were both higher than those of the A2780+CRM197 group [(546 +/- 85) mm3 vs (1 355 +/- 119) mm3, (0.56 +/- 0.09)g vs(1.31 +/- 0.27)g; all P < 0.01]. The CRM197 inhibition rate of the A2780+ CRM197 and A2780/Taxol + CRM197 group were 43% and 68% respectively, showed that CRM197 significantly suppressed the growth of A2780/Taxol xenografts in vivo(P < 0.01).

N2  -  In the mid 1990s, researchers began to investigate the antiangiogenic activity of paclitaxel as a possible additional mechanism contributing to its antineoplastic activity in vivo. In the last decade, a number of studies showed that paclitaxel has antiangiogenic activity that could be ascribed to the inhibition of either tubule formation or cell migration, and to an antiproliferative effect towards activated endothelial cells. Furthermore, paclitaxel was shown to downregulate VEGF and Ang-1 expression in tumor cells, and to increase the secretion of TSP-1 in the tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the new pharmaceutical formulations of paclitaxel (such as liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel, ABI-007, and paclitaxel entrapped in emulsifying wax nanoparticles) enhanced the in vivo antiangiogenic activity of the drug. Thus, the preclinical data of paclitaxel may be exploited to implement a novel and rational therapeutic strategy to control tumor progression in patients. © 2013 The Author(s).

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol), one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, is poorly soluble in water and requires cremophor, which often causes infusion reactions, as a solvent. Nanoxel, a nanoparticle formulation of the taxane, has been approved by the Indian regulatory authority. In the present article, we aim to describe the experience with the use of Nanoxel in India and its clinical and economic implications. We present three retrospective series in a common practice environment and an economic model. The first series shows no reactions in 596 Nanoxel infusions; the second series shows comparable adverse events other than infusion reactions between 83 patients who received Nanoxel and 32 treated with conventional paclitaxel. The third reveals comparable clinical outcomes for 51 patients treated with Nanoxel or conventional paclitaxel for gastroesophageal tumors. Finally, we describe an economic model which estimates savings of 21 580 Indian rupees per cycle with Nanoxel vis-a-vis conventional paclitaxel in the treatment of solid tumors in India. In conclusion, in an era in which the greatest challenge we face as medical oncologists is how to conciliate hard-won and incremental-but small-improvements in survival with exponentially rising drugs costs, it is refreshing to see a potential new formulation of a commonly used drug that may actually generate cost-savings while improving clinical outcomes and patient well-being. Further studies are clearly warranted to determine the optimal dose and schedule for Nanoxel as well as its comparative effectiveness to cremophor-based paclitaxel. © The Author 2013.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs ever developed and is active against a broad range of cancers, such as lung, ovarian, and breast cancers. Due to its low water solubility, paclitaxel is formulated in a mixture of Cremophor EL and dehydrated ethanol (50:50, v/v) a combination known as Taxol. However, Taxol has some severe side effects related to Cremophor EL and ethanol. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative Taxol formulations. The encapsulation of paclitaxel in biodegradable and non-toxic nanodelivery systems can protect the drug from degradation during circulation and in-turn protect the body from toxic side effects of the drug thereby lowering its toxicity, increasing its circulation half-life, exhibiting improved pharmacokinetic profiles, and demonstrating better patient compliance. Also, nanoparticle-based delivery systems can take advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for passive tumor targeting, therefore, they are promising carriers to improve the therapeutic index and decrease the side effects of paclitaxel. To date, paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticles (Abraxane ) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, there are a number of novel paclitaxel nanoparticle formulations in clinical trials. In this comprehensive review, several types of developed paclitaxel nano-delivery systems will be covered and discussed, such as polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based formulations, polymer conjugates, inorganic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, nanocrystals, and cyclodextrin nanoparticles.& copy 2013 Ma P, et al.

N2  -  Although the employment of biomedical colloids is not new, modern biomedical colloids, termed nanomedicines and nanodiagnostics, have enhanced functionality, in that the drug compound/diagnostic probe entrapped within the nanoparticle takes on the properties of the encapsulating nanoparticle. The nanoparticle's properties are specifically dictated by its size, shape, and surface chemistry; the net result in the case of medicines is an alteration of the drug's intrinsic pharmacokinetics and eventual drug targeting to the areas of pathology. The first nanomedicines, which really altered the pharmacokinetics of a drug molecule, were licensed in the early-to-mid 1990s. Since this time, these pioneering nanomedicines: liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) and liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome), have been followed by medicines such as albumin-stabilised paclitaxel (Abraxane) and biomedical sentinel lymph node nanodiagnostics such as Sienna+. The clinical trials database is heavily populated with nanosystem trials-an indication that these agents are growing in stature and will be utilised in an expanding list of clinical situations. Although the intravenous route is the route of choice for the current nanoparticles, new administration routes such as the pulmonary route are already in clinical testing, and researchers are working on the preclinical development of oral nanomedicines. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  BACKGROUND:: Paclitaxel (PTX; Taxol, Abraxane) is used in many regimens for breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ovarian cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PTX exhibits a greater than 10-fold interpatient variability of clearance rates when patients are dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships have been elucidated from BSA-based dosing. PTX is a candidate for dose management, and studies have shown that therapeutic dose management (TDM) is feasible and may provide improved outcomes for patients undergoing treatment. METHOD(S):: A PTX immunoassay (MyPaclitaxel) has been developed, which employs a novel PTX monoclonal antibody in a nanoparticle-based turbidimetric assay in a competitive format. Precision, accuracy, and linearity were evaluated by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute protocols at 3 laboratories on the Olympus AU400 analyzer. Method comparison was done versus a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method using samples (n = 119) collected from patients on PTX therapy. RESULT(S):: The assay requires 8 muL of plasma sample and can produce 400 determinations per hour. The response curve is based on a 6-point nonlinear curve fit and has a range of 0-320 ng/mL, extended to 3200 ng/mL with 10-fold autodilution. Three controls and 4 patient pools were used in precision studies. For all samples across 3 sites, repeatability coefficient of variation percentages ranged 0.9%-4.9%, and within-laboratory coefficient of variation percentages were 1.0%-4.2% with standard curve stability up to 24 days. Linearity was demonstrated over the linear range. Lower limits of detection and quantitation were 11 and 19 ng/mL, respectively. Method comparison results were analyzed by Deming regression, demonstrating a slope = 1.002 and intercept = -3.029 and an R = 0.996. The PTX samples ranged from 24 to 3164 ng/mL with a mean of 745 ng/mL. CONCLUSION(S):: The analytical performance of an automated immunoassay for PTX has been validated and may serve as a useful tool for TDM of this drug.

N2  -  Objective: Dexamethasone premedication is required with paclitaxel to prevent infusionrelated hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Both oral dexamethasone (PO-D; 20 mg 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel) and intravenous dexamethasone (IV-D; 20 mg 30 minutes before paclitaxel) regimens are used. The optimal premedication regimen and management of patients after HSR are unclear. Method(s): Data on HSRs in women receiving paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2, every 3 weeks at Imperial College Healthcare Trust from May 2011 to February 2012 were obtained from the pharmacy database. During this period, dexamethasone premedication for paclitaxel was administered orally (PO-D; 20 mg 12 and 6 hours before paclitaxel) from May to August 2011, then changed to intravenous dexamethasone (IV-D; 20 mg 30 minutes before paclitaxel) for 3 months, and then reverted to PO-D from November 2011. There were 93 and 55 patients who received PO-D and IV-D before paclitaxel, respectively. Hypersensitivity reaction rates were pooled with those from published studies for analysis. Gynecologic oncology centers in the UK and Canada were surveyed regarding premedication and post-HSR management. A Markov Monte-Carlo simulation model compared costs and benefits of different strategies. Result(s): Hypersensitivity reaction rates with PO-D and IV-D were 5.4% (5/93) versus 14.5% (8/55) (P = 0.07) in Imperial College Healthcare Trust patients, and 6.8% (20/290) versus 14.1% (30/212) (P = 0.009) on pooled analysis with data from 2 additional studies (502 patients), respectively. However, IV-D is the most common premedication regimen used in the UK and Canada (48.5% and 34.2% of centers). Post-HSR paclitaxel on a desensitization protocol is a cost-effective alternative to discontinuing paclitaxel altogether. Conclusion(s): Oral dexamethasone seems to be superior to IV-D in preventing HSRs. Post- HSR patients should be considered for desensitization. Copyright © 2013 by IGCS and ESGO.

N2  -  Exogenous cell-permeable C6 ceramide has been demonstrated to act synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, to induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that C6 ceramide and paclitaxel function synergistically to induce ovarian cancer cell death via modulation of the PI3/AKT cell survival pathway. In the present study, the entry pattern of C6 ceramide into ovarian cancer cells was investigated using fluorescent short chain C6-NBD sphingomyelin (C6-NBD). Confocal microscopy revealed that C6-NBD enters the cells in a polarized pattern, cha racterized by marked signals at one cellular end, representing a likely mitosis initiation site. Pretreatment of the cells with flipin, an inhibitor of the lipid raft/caveolae endocytosis pathway, decreases C6-NBD entry into the cells. A pretreatment with the water channel inhibitor, CuSO4, was also found to reduce the entry of C6-NBD. Notably, the pretreat-ment with paclitaxel was shown to disrupt the polarized entry of C6-NBD into the cells, resulting in an even distribution of C6-NBD in the cytoplasm. In addition, the pretreatment of the cells with paclitaxel destabilized the cytoskeletal proteins, releasing an increased number of short tubulin fragments. The results of the present study indicate that C6 ceramide preferentially enters the cells via a predetermined initiation site of mitosis. In addition to diffusion, short chain C6 ceramide may also enter cells via water channels and caveolae-mediated endo-cytosis. Paclitaxel disrupts the cell cytoskeleton and induces an even distribution of C6 ceramide in the cytoplasm resulting in synergistic ovarian cancer cell death.

N2  -  Introduction: An increasing research interest has been directed toward nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for their advantages. The appropriate amalgamation of pH sensitivity and tumor targeting is a promising strategy to fabricate drug delivery systems with high efficiency, high selectivity and low toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): A novel pH sensitive Cremophor-free paclitaxel formulation, NanoxelTM, was developed in which the drug is delivered as nanomicelles using a polymeric carrier that specifically targets tumors. The efficiency and mechanism of intracellular paclitaxel delivery by NanoxelTM was compared with two other commercially available paclitaxel formulations: AbraxaneTM and IntaxelTM, using different cell lines representing target cancers [breast, ovary and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)] by transmission electron microscopy and quantitative intracellular paclitaxel measurements by high performance liquid chromatography. Result(s): The data obtained from the present study revealed that the uptake of nanoparticle-based formulations NanoxelTM and AbraxaneTM is mediated by the process of endocytosis and the uptake of paclitaxel was remarkably superior to IntaxelTM in all cell lines tested. Moreover, the intracellular uptake of paclitaxel in NanoxelTM- and AbraxaneTM-treated groups was comparable. Hence, the nanoparticle-based formulations of paclitaxel (NanoxelTM and AbraxaneTM) are endowed with higher efficiency to deliver the drug to target cells as compared to the conventional Cremophor-based formulation. Conclusion(s): NanoxelTM appears to be of great promise in tumor targeting and may provide an advantage for paclitaxel delivery into cancer cells. © 2012 Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).

N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) stands as the poorest prognostic tumor of the digestive tract, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5 %. Therapeutic options for unresectable PDAC are extremely limited and there is a pressing need for expanded therapeutic approaches to improve current options available with gemcitabine-based regimens. With PDAC displaying one of the most prominent desmoplastic stromal reactions of all carcinomas, recent research has focused on the microenvironment surrounding PDAC cells. Secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which is overexpressed in PDAC, may display tumor suppressor functions in several cancers (e.g., in colorectal, ovarian, prostate cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemia) but also appears to be overexpressed in other tumor types (e.g., breast cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma). The apparent contradictory functions of SPARC may yield inhibition of angiogenesis via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, while promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion through matrix metalloprotease expression. This feature is of particular interest in PDAC where SPARC overexpression in the stroma stands along with inhibition of angiogenesis and promotion of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Several therapeutic strategies to deplete stromal tissue have been developed. In this review, we focused on key preclinical and clinical data describing the role of SPARC in PDAC biology, the properties, and mechanisms of delivery of drugs that interact with SPARC and discuss the proof-of-concept clinical trials using nab-paclitaxel. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  -  Sensory neuropathy is a common but difficult to quantify complication encountered during treatment of various cancers with taxane-containing regimens. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and its nanoparticle albumin-bound formulation have been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials comparing various dose and schedules for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. This review highlights differences in extent of severe neuropathies encountered in such randomized trials and seeks to draw conclusions in terms of known pharmacologic factors that may lead to neuropathy. This basic knowledge provides an essential background for exploring pharmacogenomic differences among patients in relation to their susceptibility of developing severe manifestations. In addition, the differences highlighted may lead to greater insight into drug and basic host factors (such as age, sex, and ethnicity) contributing to axonal injury from taxanes. ©2013 AACR.

N2  -  With countless research papers using preclinical models and showing the superiority of nanoparticle design over current drug therapies used to treat cancers, it is surprising how deficient the translation of these nano-sized drug carriers into the clinical setting is. This review article seeks to compare the preclinical and clinical results for Doxil, PK1, Abraxane, Genexol-PM, XyotaxTM, NC-6004, Mylotarg, PK2, and CALAA-01. While not comprehensive, it covers nano-sized drug carriers designed to improve the efficacy of common drugs used in chemotherapy. While not always available or comparable, effort was made to compare the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and efficacy between the animal and human studies.

N2  -  Improving the efficacy-toxicity balance of anticancer agents remains an ongoing challenge in oncology. Beside the ever-growing development of innovative drugs addressing newly discovered molecular targets, nanotechnologies provide today a promising and exciting strategy to achieve this goal. The idea of carrying active compounds to their respective targets so as to improve their efficacy while sparing healthy tissue and reducing side-effects is not new. However, this area of research is in constant rise, and benefits from the latest advances in the field of biopharmaceutics, medicinal chemistry and nanomedicine. In addition to anthracyclines already widely present as liposomal drugs on the shelves, a variety of anticancer drugs can be now encapsulated into different chemical of structures so as to enhance their specificity toward malignant cells, mainly through improved pharmacokinetics profiles. Indeed, the recent advances in chemistry allow now a wide variety of scaffolds to be used as drug-carriers, so as optimize the delivery of cytotoxics. Even more recently, conjugated-drugs such as nanoalbumin (Nab) conjugates have emerged as a new promising alternative to improve both anticancer drugs distribution in the body and efficacy/toxicity balance eventually. This review covers the achievements and current limits of nanoparticles in oncology, with a special focus on nab-paclitaxel as a paradigmatic drug for this new generation of conjugated entities. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  In recent years, drug delivery systems (DDS) have been developed, along with anticancer agents for those systems based on the concept of achieving a better clinical response and tolerability. Several clinical trials have shown that these drugs have better clinical effects in the treatment of many cancers, leading to their expanded indications. Liposomal doxorubicin is one DDS agent used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian cancer in Japan. In addition to those two indications, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2007. Another DDS agent approved in Japan is nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, which has been used in the treatment of breast cancer. Most recently, this drug has been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S.A. Although these DDS agents appear to be less toxic than conventional drugs, DDS-specific side effects such as various skin reactions, hypersensitivity reaction, and peripheral neuropathy sometimes occur. Therefore, medical staff must understand DDS anticancer agents fully, including characteristic side effects, to achieve the desired clinical outcomes. © 2013 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

N2  -  Taxanes are a key chemotherapy component for several malignancies, including metastatic breast cancer (MBC), ovarian cancer, and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the clinical benefit achieved with solvent-based (sb) taxanes, these agents can be associated with significant and severe toxic-ities. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane; nab-Paclitaxel), a novel solvent-free taxane, has demonstrated higher response rates and improved tolerability when compared with solvent-based formulations in patients with advanced MBC and NSCLC. The technology used to create nab-paclitaxel utilizes albumin to deliver paclitaxel, resulting in an advantageous pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. This review discusses the proposed mechanism of delivery of nab-paclitaxel, including an examination into a hypothesized greater ability to leverage albumin-based transport relative to sb-paclitaxel. An advantageous PK profile and the more efficient use of albumin-based transport may contribute to the preclinical finding that nab-paclitaxel achieves a 33% higher tumor uptake relative to sb-paclitaxel. Another possible contributing factor to the tumor accumulation of nab-paclitaxel is the binding of albumin to secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), although the data supporting this relationship between SPARC and nab-paclitaxel remain largely correlative at this point. Recent data also suggest that nab-paclitaxel may enhance tumor accumulation of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer treated with both agents. Additionally, a possible mechanistic synergy between nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine has been cited as the rationale to combine the two agents for MBC treatment. Thus, nab-paclitaxel appears to interact with tumors in a number of interesting, but not fully understood, ways. Continued preclinical and clinical research across a range of tumor types is warranted to answer the questions that remain on the mechanisms of delivery and antitumor activity of nab-paclitaxel. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Objective: We examined the safety and efficacy of combining bevacizumab with albumin-bound (ab-) paclitaxel to treat patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant primary epithelial ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma. Method(s): Patients had measurable disease per RECIST guidelines, progressing within 6 months after a prior course of platinum-based treatment. Patients received ab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 given by intravenous infusion over 30 min on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 15. Result(s): Forty-eight patients with an average 1.8 prior lines of treatment participated. The overall response rate was 50% (24/48) (95% CI, 34.8% - 65.1%), with 4 complete and 20 partial responses. Fourteen patients (29%) had stable disease, whereas eight (17%) had progressive disease, and two (4%) were not evaluable. Patients received a median of 6 treatment cycles (range, 1 - 31 cycles). The median progression-free survival was 8.08 months (95% CI, 5.78 - 10.15 months); 6 month progression-free rate was 62.5% (95% CI, 47.8%-77.2%); median overall survival was 17.15 months (95% CI, 13.57 - 23.82 months). Grade 3-4 adverse events included gastrointestinal disorders (18.8%), neutropenia (8.3%), and hypertension (6.3%). Conclusion(s): Ab-paclitaxel with bevacizumab clearly demonstrates antitumor activity and manageable toxicity profile in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma. This regimen should be evaluated in a larger randomized trial. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: LCL161 is a small molecule that triggers tumor cell apoptosis by selectively antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Preclinical studies demonstrated antitumor efficacy of LCL161 alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, acting synergistically with paclitaxel in breast cancer models. A Phase I study confirmed potent pharmacodynamic (PD) effects at well-tolerated doses of 1800 mg once weekly. The purpose of this Phase Ib study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of LCL161 in combination with weekly paclitaxel. Method(s): Patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors were treated with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 each week, immediately followed by escalating doses of LCL161 administered once weekly. PK and biomarker sampling was performed. Patients with breast or ovarian cancer were treated at the MTD/R2PD in the dose-expansion phase of the study. Result(s): As of 4 June 2013, 61 patients have received LCL161 doses of 600 mg (n = 3), 1200 mg (n = 5), 1500 mg (n = 5), and 1800 mg (n = 48), including 26 patients with breast cancer and 19 patients with ovarian cancer. Median duration of exposure was 10 weeks. The most common LCL161-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (53%), anemia (36%), and neutropenia (34%). Eleven patients experienced AEs indicated by the principal investigator as a toxicity requiring dose reduction or a change to a 3 week on/1 week off schedule (ten at 1800 mg and one at 1200 mg), seven of which were neutropenia or febrile neutropenia. The MTD was not reached, and 1800 mg was selected as the RP2D. In the safety expansion group of patients with breast cancer treated at 1800 mg, 17 (out of 20) patients were evaluable for response by investigator assessment using RECIST criteria; of these, 47% achieved a partial response, 35% had stable disease, and 18% developed progressive disease. Interestingly, responses were seen in patients with documented progression to prior taxane-based regimens. Of note, in the ovarian cancer cohort, one patient achieved a complete response. In the study overall, 26% achieved a partial response, and 30% experienced stable disease. No PK interaction between LCL161 and paclitaxel was observed. Discussion(s): Combination therapy with LCL161 and paclitaxel is well tolerated, with manageable toxicities and encouraging clinical efficacy in breast cancer. Enrollment of additional patients with breast cancer resistant to paclitaxel is ongoing.

N2  -  Background: Gemcitabine (Gem), a standard cytotoxic therapy for pancreatic cancer, has shown limited clinical benefits. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (NPT), an approved treatment for breast cancer, has shown efficacy as mono- and combination therapy in multiple tumor types including pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer. We evaluated the NPT treatment benefits compared with Gem or solvent-based taxane docetaxel (DT) in experimental pancreatic cancer. Method(s): In vitro cell proliferation and protein expression were measured by WST-1 assay and immunoblotting. Tumor growth and animal survival studies were performed in murine xenografts. Intratumoral proliferative activity was measured using Ki67 nuclear antigen staining. Result(s): For AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells in vitro, Gem IC50 levels were 23.9 ?M, 506 nM, 332 nM and 14.5 nM; DT IC50 levels were 30 nM, 4.6 nM, 37.5 nM and 27 nM; and NPT IC50 levels were 7.6 ?M, 208 nM, 519 nM and 526 nM. NPT addition decreased Gem IC50 to 1.7 ?M, 189 nM, 123 nM and 913 nM; DT addition decreased Gem IC50 to 436 nM, 470 nM, 124 nM and 0.2 nM in AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, respectively. NPT and DT treatment increased stathmin phosphorylation and decreased tubulin expression in vitro. In a heterotopic in vivo model, net tumor growth inhibition after Gem, DT and NPT was 67, 31 and 72 percent, while intratumoral proliferative index inhibition was 41, 53 and 68 percent, respectively. In an intraperitoneal model, median animal survival was significantly longer in the NPT treatment group (41 days, p<0.002 vs. control and Gem) compared to Gem (32 days, p=0.005 vs. control), DT (32 days, p=0.005 vs. control) and controls (20 days). Animal survival in NPT-Gem and DT-Gem sequential treatment groups was 43 and 40 days, and thus not superior to NPT alone. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel has significantly superior antitumor activity as a single agent in experimental pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine or docetaxel. These findings provide a strong rationale for considering nab-paclitaxel as first-line monotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

N2  -  Introduction: IG-001, like nab-paclitaxel, is a polymer bound nanoparticle paclitaxel. It is being developed for difficult to perfuse hypoxic tumors such as pancreatic cancer and ovarian cancer. IG-001 has shown promising activity against ovarian cancer in phase II clinical trials. In the planned phase III trial of IG-001, serum biomarkers as well as blood paclitaxel will be monitored to as prognostic indicators of response. The goal of this study is to developed point-of-care testing devices for PD biomarkers including CA125, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and blood paclitaxel. Method(s): Serum samples collected at time of diagnosis of ovarian cancer were tested using rapid and quantitative point-of-care (POC) devices for blood biomarkers (CA125, FSH, BNP, and paclitaxel) and the data were evaluated using JMP9 statistical analysis software. Result(s): 41 ovarian cancer patients were analyzed for CA125 prior to surgery of which 3 (7%), 11 (27%), and 27 (66%) were clear cell carcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively. CA125 was not diagnostic of ovarian cancer. However, incidence of elevated (BNP > 25 pg/ml) was higher for patients (14 of 19, 74%) vs. normal controls (3 of 10, 30%, p = 0.02, Chi-square). FSH level was higher (median=151.6 mU/ml) vs. normal controls (median of 13.4 mU/ml, p = 0.01, Wilcoxon). Paclitaxel POC device was developed to monitored paclitaxel level down to 20ng/mL for paclitaxel. Conclusion(s): Rapid and quantitative point-of-care tests for PD biomarker testing and paclitaxel PK therapeutic drug monitoring have been developed for use in conjunction with IG-001 development against ovarian cancer. IG-001 is ideal for paclitaxel therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) due to its dose proportional PK. Paclitaxel TDM should allow for more effective dosing of the patients and thereby improving effectiveness of IG-001. These POCTs are also patient-centric, inviting better compliance and patient participation in personalizing his/her treatment. Plasma or serum samples obtained via repetitive venipuncture represent the accepted gold standard for monitoring the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of anticancer agents. Unfortunately for research subjects, the burden of frequent venipuncture is high; and, for researchers, venipuncture samples require immediate processing and storage facilities with freezers. The work presented here resolved the operational difficulty associated with personalized therapy in general and IG-001 in specific.

N2  -  To further characterize the molecular basis on anticancer drug-resistance of human ovarian carcinoma, we compared glycolipid and transporter gene expressions in ovarian serous carcinoma-derived KF28 and 2008 cells with those in their paclitaxel- and cisplatin-resistant cells. Lipid compositions were determined by TLC and TLC-immunostaining and gene expressions of transporter proteins and glycosyltransferases were by RT-PCR. Although the amounts of major lipids, i.e. cholesterol, ceramides and phospholipids, in the resistant cells were same with those in the sensitive cells, Gb3Cer was commonly increased in all resistant cells, irrespective of whether the resistance was to paclitaxel or cisplatin. Also, expressions of the MDR1 gene and gangliosides, GM3 for KF28, and GM1 and GD1a for 2008 cells, were enhanced in paclitaxel-resistant cells, but gangliosides were absent in cisplatin-resistant cells. In accord with the decreased amounts of gangliosides in cisplatin-resistant cells, the gene expression and specific activity of GM3 synthase were greatly decreased in cisplatin-resistant cells. One can suggest that increased amount of Gb3Cer in cisplatin-resistant cells is brought about by the metabolic shifts of LacCer-modifying pathway from GM3- to Gb3Cer-synthases. Furthermore, paclitaxel- and cisplatin-resistant cells were converted to forms more sensitive to the respective anticancer drugs on cultivation with D-PDMP, an inhibitor of GlcCer synthase, and GM3, respectively, prior to the addition of anticancer drugs. Thus, coexpression of the MDR1 gene and glycolipids including gangliosides was thought to be necessary for survival of cells in media containing paclitaxel through regulation of transporter proteins with glycolipids in membrane rafts. Also, the decreased amounts of gangliosides might contribute to the cisplatin resistance, probably by the reduced incorporation of cisplatin.

N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by early tissue invasion and metastasis, complex desmoplastic stromal response, and high resistance to systemic therapies. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (NPT) has the potential for pharmacodynamic advantages over conventional taxanes and has shown efficacy as mono- and combination therapeutic agent in several malignancies including pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer. We evaluated the combination treatment benefits of nab-paclitaxel with the antiangiogenic agents bevacizumab (Bev) and sunitinib (Su) in experimental pancreatic cancer. In vitro cell proliferation and protein expression were measured by WST-1 assay and immunoblotting. Tumor growth and animal survival studies were performed in murine xenografts. Intratumoral proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated via Ki67 and TUNEL staining. Nab-paclitaxel displayed higher in vitro antiproliferative activity as a single agent in pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine or the polysorbate-based taxane docetaxel. In AsPC-1 PDAC cells, nab-paclitaxel IC50 was reduced more than 6-fold by an IC25 dose of sunitinib (500 nM) but not by bevacizumab (10 mug/ml). In endothelial cells HUVEC, nab-paclitaxel IC50 (82 nM) was decreased to 41 nM by bevacizumab (10 mug/ml) and to 63 nM by sunitinib (100 nM). In fibroblast WI-38 cells, nab-paclitaxel IC50 (7.2 muM) was decreased to 7.8 nM by the IC25 dose of sunitinib (2.5 muM), but no significant decrease was observed by bevacizumab (50 mug/ml) addition. Nab-paclitaxel increased stathmin phosphorylation and decreased tubulin expression in vitro. In a subcutaneous murine xenograft model, net tumor growth inhibition in NPT, Bev, Su, Bev+Su, NPT+Bev, NPT+Su and NPT+Bev+Su was 72, 44, 61, 89, 67, 93 and 86 percent. Effects of therapy on intratumoral proliferation and apoptosis corresponded with tumor growth inhibition data. In tumor tissue lysates, nab-paclitaxel caused an increase in stathmin phosphorylation but no change in tubulin expression. In an intraperitoneal murine xenograft model, compared to controls (median survival: 19 days), animal survival increased after nab-paclitaxel (32 days, p=0.0008) but not after antiangiogenic therapy with Bev (21 days), Su (24 days) or Bev+Su (22 days; for all: p=NS). Animal survival was further increased by the combination treatment of nab-paclitaxel with bevacizumab and sunitinib, with a median survival of 38, 37 and 49 days in NPT+Bev (p=0.03 vs. NPT), NPT+Su (p=0.174 vs. NPT) and NPT+Bev+Su (p=0.001 vs. NPT) groups, respectively. Nab-paclitaxel has strong antitumor activity as a single agent in this model of experimental pancreatic cancer. Nab-paclitaxel effects were further enhanced by addition of the antiangiogenic agents bevacizumab and sunitinib. These findings strongly support the potential of nab-paclitaxel based combination strategies for clinical PDAC therapy.

N2  -  Introduction Background: We conducted trial to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of paclitaxel with albumin in patients with terminal stage of ovarian cancer. It's known that normal concentration of albumin in blood considerably increased the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents. Objective(s): We selected 12 patients with terminal stage of ovarian cancer T4N2M1with ascites. Methods Methods: We carried out to all patients Paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 in 5 % 500 ml of dextrose during 180 min with albumin 20 %-100 ml during 5 h intravenously, simultaneously and repeated that course each 7 days during 2 month depending on common condition of the patient and laboratory analysis Results Results: After appropriate postchemotherapeutic and symptomatic therapy we took normal blood tests and decreasing of tumor. Common condition of patients improved after 4th course, decreased ascites and observed less toxicity of paclitaxel. Conclusions Conclusion(s): As we showed above we selected patients at the stage of T4N2M1, by ECOG standard 3 points conducted micro dose long term chemotherapy with albumin and took expected results. We observed patients that by ECOG points decreased even to 1, disappeared ascites, and improved quality of life.

N2  -  Objective: Ovarian cancer represents the most common cause of death among gynecological malignancies. Chemotherapy in this cancers is still not satisfactory because of drug resistance. The main mechanism of drug resistance results from the ability of cancer cells to actively expel therapeutic agents via transport proteins of the ABC family. Recent investigations indicate that aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1A1) can also be involved in drug resistance of ovarian cancer. Method(s): A chemosensitivity assay MTT test was performed to assess drug cross-resistance. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were performed to determine mRNA and protein expression of genes involved in chemoresistance. Result(s): We observed overexpression of ALDH1A1 in primary ovarian cancer cell lines resistant do topotecan and paclitaxel at mRNA and protein level. Pre-treatment with all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) sensitised these cell lines to topotecan and paclitaxel. Treatment with ATRA leads to downregulation of ALDH1A1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 at protein but not mRNA level. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that ATRA regulate expression of ALDH1A1 ABCB1 and ABCG2 at post-translational level. Downregulation of these proteins is very important from therapeutic point of view. ATRA could be considered as a therapeutic agent in combination with cytostatics in ovarian cancer therapy.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel's antineoplastic activity is limited by its solubility and toxicity. Encapsulation with polyethyloxazoline (PEOX) branched polymers can increase its solubility, decrease toxicity and enhance its antitumor efficacy. Method(s): Paclitaxel was mixed with PEOX-based branched polymers at drug loading percentages of 11 - 17% to form nanoparticles (< 90 nm in diameter). The product was purified and lyophilized as a white powder, designated FID-007. Its cytotoxicity was tested on normal human fibroblast cells and cell lines for human lung (A549), triple negative breast (MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (OV-90) cancers. Commercial paclitaxel drugs, Taxol and Abraxane, were similarly tested. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the three drugs were determined in CD-1 mice. FID-007's efficacy in controlling tumor growth was compared to the other drugs in vivo using xenograft tumor models in Scid mice with the three human cancer cell lines (20 mice per cancer). Saline and polymer were used as negative control treatments. Result(s): FID-007, Taxol and Abraxane showed similar cytotoxicity to all cancers.FID-007 was > 10-fold less active in normal fibroblasts. The single dose MTD in CD-1 mice was < 30 mg/kg for Taxol, 175 mg/kg for FID-007 and >180 mg/kg for Abraxane. FID-007 exhibited the best efficacy in controlling tumor growth in mice compared to Taxol and Abraxane with the three human cancers. Results from the lung tumor study are presented in the Table. Conclusion(s): Encapsulation with PEOX-based polymers reduced the toxicity and significantly improved the efficacy of paclitaxel in controlling tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.

N2  -  Background: IP therapy is an attractive option for patients with IP carcinomatosis as many of these malignancies remain confined IP. Agents whose plasma clearance rates substantially exceed their rates of uptake from the peritoneal cavity are especially suited for IP administration. Pre-clinical studies of a novel formulation of nanoparticulate paclitaxel in animal tumor models demonstrated superior activity and substantially reduced systemic toxicity. This allowed for significant IP doses and concentrations, yet yielded very low systemic concentrations of paclitaxel. We report here the results of a Phase I trial of IP administered NTX. Method(s): Patients (ECOG<=2) had relapsed, treatment refractory solid IP tumors and adequate organ function. NTX was administered IP as a bolus injection after 500 ml saline followed by IP administration of up to 2 L of saline. We utilized an accelerated dose escalation scheme until one DLT occurred during cycle 1, followed by a standard dose escalation (3+3 design) based on CTCAE V3 toxicities. The pharmacokinetics of IP administered NTX were characterized in plasma and ascites fluid. Secondary objectives were to define the recommended phase 2 dose of NTX, and characterize preliminary activity and toxicity. Result(s): 20 patients were treated at dose levels from 50 - 275 mg/M2 q 28 days. Primary malignancy was ovarian cancer (74%). Treatment was well tolerated at all dose levels. Common toxicities potentially related to NTX were: gastrointestinal (68%), constitutional (42%), and pain (42%). Average number of cycles received was 2 (range 1 to 6). Best response was stable disease (4 patients, 21%). Median length of disease stability was 99 days (range 85 to 151 days); median time on study patients with stable disease was 313 days (range 142 to 740 days). All Cmax in plasma were less than 35 ng/mL, with ascites fluid Cmax generally greater than 1000 ng/mL. Conclusion(s): IP NTX is well tolerated. MTD has not yet been reached. Pharmacokinetic data demonstrate significant, persistent IP exposure to paclitaxel with minimal systemic exposure. Accrual at the 275 mg/M2 dose level continues; updated results will be presented. Further clinical development of NTX is indicated. Clinical trial information: NCT00666991.

N2  -  Most solid tumors are of epithelial origin. Epithelial cancers maintain intercellular junctions that link cancer cells together and prevent the penetration of therapeutics deep into the cancer. Several studies demonstrated that the upregulation of epithelial junction proteins correlated with increased resistance to therapy, including therapy with monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapeutics. One of the epithelial junction proteins is desmoglein 2 (DSG2). Recently we demonstrated that a group of human adenoviruses (Ad) (Ad serotype 3, 7, 11, and 14) use DSG2 as a primary attachment receptor for the infection of cells. DSG2 is overexpressed in epithelial malignancies. We have created a small recombinant protein derived from Ad serotype 3. This protein binds to DSG2 and triggers transient opening of epithelial junctions. We therefore named the protein "JO-1" ("junction opener -1"). JO-1 is produced in E.coli and can be easily purified. In a number of xenograft tumor models, we have shown that intravenous injection of JO-1 increased the efficacy of monoclonal antibody (e.g. trastuzumab/Herceptin and cetuximab/ Erbitux) therapy. Many chemotherapy drugs are larger than 500 Da, the upper limit of molecules that are able to pass through tight junctions. We have demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of several of these drugs, including paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, docetaxel irinotecan, and liposomal doxorubicin are increased by co-therapy with JO-1. Furthermore, we have shown that JO-1 leads to massive accumulation of chemotherapy drugs in the tumor, decreasing the drug concentrations in the rest of the body. This resulted in the elimination of chemotherapy-related toxicities to bone marrow, liver, and intestine. Toxicology studies carried out in mice and monkeys have shown that intravenous injection of JO-1 is safe and well-tolerated Additional in vivo studies have demonstrated that JO-1 remains active in the presence of anti-JO-1 antibodies. In immunocompetent DSG2 transgenic mice with syngeneic tumors, JO-1 significantly enhanced PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) therapy when given in multiple cycles with an interval of 2 weeks. More recently, we have used immunocompetent animal models to demonstrate that JO-1 treatment also enhances the intratumoral penetration and efficacy of anti-tumor T-cells. We are now focused on the clinical translation of JO-1 in combination with Doxil for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Background: Gemcitabine (Gem), a standard cytotoxic therapy for pancreatic cancer, has shown limited clinical benefits. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (NPT), an approved treatment for breast cancer, has shown efficacy as mono- and combination therapy in multiple tumor types including pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer. We evaluated the NPT treatment benefits compared with Gem or solvent-based taxane docetaxel (DT) in experimental pancreatic cancer. Method(s): In vitro cell proliferation and protein expression were measured by WST-1 assay and immunoblotting. Tumor growth and animal survival studies were performed in murine xenografts. Intratumoral proliferative activity was measured using Ki67 nuclear antigen staining. Result(s): For AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells in vitro, Gem IC50 levels were 23.9 mM, 506 nM, 332 nM and 14.5 nM; DT IC50 levels were 30 nM, 4.6 nM, 37.5 nM and 27 nM; and NPT IC50 levels were 7.6 mM, 208 nM, 519 nM and 526 nM. NPT addition decreased Gem IC50 to 1.7 mM, 189 nM, 123 nM and 913 nM; DT addition decreased Gem IC50 to 436 nM, 470 nM, 124 nM and 0.2 nM in AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, respectively. NPT and DT treatment increased stathmin phosphorylation and decreased tubulin expression in vitro. In a heterotopic in vivo model, net tumor growth inhibition after Gem, DT and NPT was 67, 31 and 72 percent, while intratumoral proliferative index inhibition was 41, 53 and 68 percent, respectively. In an intraperitoneal model, median animal survival was significantly longer in the NPT treatment group (41 days, p<0.002 vs. control and Gem) compared to Gem (32 days, p=0.005 vs. control), DT (32 days, p=0.005 vs. control) and controls (20 days). Animal survival in NPT-Gem and DT-Gem sequential treatment groups was 43 and 40 days, and thus not superior to NPT alone. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel has significantly superior antitumor activity as a single agent in experimental pancreatic cancer compared with gemcitabine or docetaxel. These findings provide a strong rationale for considering nab-paclitaxel as first-line monotherapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.

N2  -  Nanoparticle-albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) represents an innovative taxane-containing formulation lacking any critical solvents with minimal risks for any hypersensitivity reactions as well as perspectives for dose escalation as a consequence. Preclinical data indicated an increase of drug accumulation in tumor tissues via nab-paclitaxel administration which appears to be related to direct interaction with albumin-binding proteins including stromal SPARC. Phase III study results revealed clinically relevant advantages regarding efficacy and tolerability associated with nab-paclitaxel compared to conventional docetaxel and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Further experience may encourage its use in other tumor entities including NSCLC, ovarian and pancreatic carcinoma as well as melanoma. As a consequence, the development of algorithms is ongoing in order to be able to select patients in more detail who will particularly benefit from nab-paclitaxel treatment.

N2  -  Anticancer drugs as well as nano-sized drug delivery systems face many barriers that hinder penetration deeply and evenly into solid tumors: a chaotic, tortuous vascular compartment resulting in tumor tissue distant from microvessels, a heterogeneous blood flow distribution with a concomitant defective microcirculatory exchange process, and a high interstitial fluid pressure. Furthermore, a resulting hostile tumor microenvironment characterized by hypoxia and/or extracellular acidosis can reduce the efficacy of anticancer drugs and confer drug resistance. Conversely, the enhanced permeation and retention effect has become the gold standard for developing macromolecular prodrugs and nano-sized drug delivery systems. Preclinically, there are meanwhile numerous in vivo proof-of-concepts that demonstrate not only a better tolerability of nano-sized drug delivery systems but also of enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to the conventional clinical standard. When faced with such a complex and heterogeneous disease as cancer in humans, it is more likely that a tailor-made combination of different therapeutic strategies will achieve the best results. In this respect, combining low-molecular weight cytostatic drugs with nano-sized drug delivery systems appears to be a natural choice for combination therapy that aims at distributing anticancer drugs at higher concentrations in the tumor in a more even manner. To date, such drug delivery approaches have been inadequately explored. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art of combination approaches with liposomal doxorubicin (DoxilTM), the paclitaxel-albumin nanoparticle (AbraxaneTM) and the albumin-binding doxorubicin prodrug DOXO-EMCH (INNO-206), and discuss the insights obtained and perspectives for further research in this intriguing and promising field of drug delivery research. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  The taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) represent an important class of antineoplastic agents that interfere with microtubule function leading to altered mitosis and cellular death. Paclitaxel (Taxol) was originally extracted from a yew tree (Taxus spp., Taxaceae) a small slow-growing evergreen, coniferous tree. Due to the initial scarcity of paclitaxel, docetaxel (Taxotere) a semisynthetic analog of paclitaxel produced from the needles of European yew tree, Taxus baccata was developed. Docetaxel differs from paclitaxel in two positions in its chemical structure and this small alteration makes it more water soluble. Today, paclitaxel and docetaxel are widely prescribed antineoplastic agents for a broad range of malignancies including lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, and other carcinomas. Although very active clinically, paclitaxel and docetaxel have several clinical problems including poor drug solubility, serious dose-limiting toxicities such as myelosuppression, peripheral sensory neuropathy, allergic reactions, and eventual development of drug resistance. A number of these side effects have been associated with the solvents used for dilution of these antineoplastic agents: Cremophor EL for paclitaxel and polysorbate 80 for docetaxel. In addition, reports have linked these solvents to the alterations in paclitaxel and docetaxel pharmacokinetic profles. In this review, we provide preclinical and clinical data on several novel taxanes formulations and analogs which are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or in clinical development in various solid tumor malignancies. Of the new taxanes nab-paclitaxel and cabazitaxel have enjoyed clinical success and are FDA-approved; while many of the other compounds described in this review are unlikely to be further developed for clinical use in daily practice. Furthermore, the successful clinical emergence of novel nontaxane microtubule-targeting chemotherapy agents such as epothilones and eribulin is liable to further restrict the development of novel taxanes. © 2012 Yared and Tkaczuk, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  -  In this paper, an overview of recent advances of paclitaxel formulations based on nanosystems is provided. Paclitaxel is very effective in the treatment of various cancers especially ovarian and breast cancer, but it demonstrates poor aqueous solubility, which results in the difficulty challenging the development of paclitaxel parenteral formulations, so its clinical application is greatly restricted. The conventional paclitaxel formulation uses Cremophor EL and ethanol to solubilize paclitaxel, which could cause severe side effects. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in the field of antitumor research, and paclitaxel is no exception. In recent decades, a series of novel formulations of paclitaxel based on nanotechnology have been developed, including albumin-bound paclitaxel, polymeric micelle-formulated paclitaxel, polymer-paclitaxel conjugates, liposome encapsulated paclitaxel etc. The common advantage shared with these novel injectable formulations is that they are developed based on nanotechnology and Cremophor EL-free. In addition, these nanoformulations can significantly reduce toxicities of paclitaxel and greatly promote its antitumor efficiency. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

N2  -  Purpose: Epithelial junctions between tumor cells inhibit the penetration of anticancer drugs into tumors. We previously reported on recombinant adenovirus serotype 3-derived protein (JO-1), which triggers transient opening of intercellular junctions in epithelial tumors through binding to desmoglein 2 (DSG2), and enhances the antitumor effects of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether JO-1 cotherapy can also improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs. Experimental Design: The effect of intravenous application of JO-1 in combination with several chemotherapy drugs, including paclitaxel/Taxol, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel/Abraxane, liposomal doxorubicin/Doxil, and irinotecan/Camptosar, was tested in xenograft models for breast, colon, ovarian, gastric and lung cancer. Because JO-1 does not bind to mouse cells, for safety studies with JO-1, we also used human DSG2 (hDSG2) transgenic mice with tumors that overexpressed hDSG2. Result(s): JO-1 increased the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, and in several models overcame drug resistance. JO-1 treatment also allowed for the reduction of drug doses required to achieve antitumor effects. Importantly, JO-1 coadmininstration protected normal tissues, including bone marrow and intestinal epithelium, against toxic effects that are normally associated with chemotherapeutic agents. Using the hDSG2-transgenic mouse model, we showed that JO-1 predominantly accumulates in tumors. Except for a mild, transient diarrhea, intravenous injection of JO-1 (2 mg/kg) had no critical side effects on other tissues or hematologic parameters in hDSG2-transgenic mice. Conclusion(s): Our preliminary data suggest that JO-1 cotherapy has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer chemotherapy. ©2012 AACR.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol), a drug used to treat solid tumors of the breast, ovary and lung, stabilizes microtubules and arrests cells in G2/M of the cell cycle. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), we examined the proteomic response of a human HL-60 promyeloid leukemic cell line to paclitaxel. Our intention was to compare the effects of paclitaxel to those of a newgeneration microtubule-stabilizing agent, peloruside A, investigated in an earlier study. In response to 100 nM paclitaxel treatment for 24 h, 21 identified proteins changed in abundance, with 13 increases and 8 decreases. In addition, 21 other unidentified proteins were also changed by treatment with paclitaxel. Using Western blotting, the transcription factor c-Myc was shown to be reduced in abundance by both drugs. Our results showed both differences and similarities at the single protein level between paclitaxel and peloruside A, although the same general classes of proteins: cytoskeletal, nucleic acid binding, stress, and apoptotic proteins, changed following exposure. The proteomic response to paclitaxel was more extensive than the response to an equipotent dose of peloruside A. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

N2  -  Objectives: Gene expression profiles of mullerian low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) were examined to identify differentially expressed genes involved in carcinogenesis and chemotherapy response. Method(s): 27 LGSC and 44 HGSC from publicly available datasets were analyzed. All specimens were laser-capture microdissected and analyzed on Affymetrix U133plus2 gene-chip microarray platform. Differentially expressed genes were filtered and subjected to a t-test with a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing. Result(s): Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed segregation of LGSC from HGSC. HGSC tumors previously classified as primary ovarian carcinoma or primary fallopian tube carcinoma clustered together irrespective of their designated origin. 475 probe-sets were at least 2 fold different between the LGSC and HGSC. LGSC were found to overexpress KLF4 and its target p21/WAF1 relative to HGSC. These proteins have both tumor suppressive and oncogenic effects. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the hypothesis that serous mullerian carcinoma may develop through two different pathways yielding two distinct malignancies- LGSC and HGSC. Gene expression analyses demonstrated overexpression of KLF4 and p21/WAF1 in LGSC. The key role of these proteins in proliferation inhibition may contribute to the differential response of LGSC to standard chemotherapy. Similarly, a novel LGSC-associated gene, Clusterin, encodes for a secreted protein previously shown to prevent paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cell lines. Suppressing the levels of these proteins may increase clinical response to chemotherapy in patients with LGSC. In addition, the genetic profiles identified in this study may potentially be used in developing disease-specific, targeted therapy for LGSC and HGSC.

N2  -  Impact on outcome in advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) can be expected from a) new cytostatic/cytotoxic drugs with new mechanisms of action (trabectedin, canfosfamide)/new formulations (nab-paclitaxel), b) deletion of old/new uneffective cytotoxic drugs (topotecan, patupilone), c) new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease by implementing a molecular classification, responding therapeutically to these new categorizations as well as pre-selecting patients and antitumor agents accordingly, d) development of drugs interfering with these newly identified pathomechanisms, e) adequate choice of trial designs. Angiogenesis: Selective inhibitors of distinct pathways have been investigated, a) VEGF (bevacizumab, VEGF-Trap), b) VEGF/PDGF (sorafenib, sunitinib), c) VEGF/PDGF/FGF (cediranib, pazopanib, vargatef), d) vascular disruption (combretastatin). The anti-VEGF MoAb bevacizumab has been registered for the platinum-taxane based first-line treatment in AOC. Significantly prolonged PFS was reached in platinum-sensitive relapsed patients. The fusion protein VEGF-Trap reached phase II. Several small molecule inhibitors (vargatef, cediranib) are in phase III testing, others (sorafenib, sunitinib) dispose on only modest phase II activity. DNA-repair: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have been proven to be highly effective with 40% ORR in BRCA mutation carriers, exploiting the concept of synthetic lethality. Whereas germline mutations in BRCA 1 and 2 with 10-15% are rare, "BRCAness", i.e. loss of BRCA function, can be detected in about 50% of high-grade serous OC. Nevertheless, a prospective randomized phase II trial in this patient population failed to improve survival. Folate transport: The folate receptor alpha targeted MoAb farletuzumab yielded a single agent ORR of 73.5% and PFS of 10.3 months. In >20%, the second PFS was as long as or longer than the first-line PFS. A phase III trial with platinum-taxane backbone +/- farletuzumab has closed enrolment. Malignant transformation: The result of erlotinib as maintenance therapy in a phase III trial is awaited. Several other small molecules (imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib) or MoAbs (cetuximab, pertuzumab, volociximab), respectively, failed and/or are not investigated further. Immunogenicity: Previous immunotherapeutic interventions were unsuccessful (IFN gamma, anti CA-125 MoAb oregovomab), others like abagovomab (anti-idiotypic CA-125 targeted MoAb) just completed phase III trial testing (MIMOSA).

N2  -  Exogenous cell permeable C6 ceramide is demonstrated to act synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs: paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) to induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells. We previously showed that C6 ceramide and paclitaxel act synergistically to induce ovarian cancer cell death via modulation of PI3/AKT cell survival pathway. This current study is focused on the process of C6 ceramide into the cell and its behavior during apoptosis. We investigated the entry pattern of C6 ceramide into ovarian cancer cells using fluorescent short chain C6-NBD sphingomyelin (or C6-NBD). As imaged with confocal microscopy, we observed that C6-NBD enters cells in a polarized pattern, characterized by strong signals at one cellular end, a probable mitosis initiation site. Pretreatment of the cells with filipin, an inhibitor of the raft/caveolae endocytosis pathway, decreases C6-NBD entry into cells. Pretreatment of water channel inhibitor CuSO4 also reduces entry of C6-NBD. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with paclitaxel disrupts the polarized entry of C6-NBD into the cells, resulting in even distribution of C6-NBD in the cytoplasm. Further studies show that pretreatment of the cells with paclitaxel destabilizes cytoskeletal proteins, releasing increased number of short fragments of tubulins. The data suggests that C6 ceramide enters the cells preferably through a predetermined initial site of mitosis. In addition to diffusion, short chain C6 ceramide enters cells also via water channels and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Paclitaxel disrupts cytoskeletons and induces an even distribution of C6 ceramide in the cytoplasm resulting in synergistic ovarian cancer cell death.

N2  -  Using a pangenomic loss of function strategy, our group has recently discovered that a cohort of gametogenic genes modulates chemoresponsiveness in tumor cells. Numerous studies focused on identifying aberrant gene expression patterns in tumors have previously correlated the presence of gametogenic genes with the tumorigenic state. Our functional genomics approach has now revealed that these tumor-activated aberrant gene products may play essential roles in supporting tumor cell fitness in the presence of insults, such as genotoxic stress. Specifically, depletion of each of the 8 gametogenic genes identified in our screen results in an increase in mitotic transit time and a reduction in mitotic fidelity in the presence of paclitaxel, demonstrating a requirement for their function at the level of chromosome segregation. At the cell biological level, these components contribute to mitotic spindle architecture by supporting centrosomal coalescence, centrosome duplication and/or microtubule stability. Given that the expression of these genes is otherwise biased towards the germline, they could present pharmacological entry points with an extraordinary therapeutic window. For example, we find that the CT-antigen, ACRBP, specifies poor outcome in ovarian patients and depletion of ACRBP can enhance sensitivity to paclitaxel in ovarian tumor explants in vitro and an ovarian orthtopic xenografts in vivo. In addition, we find that a small molecule that targets the gametogenic protein, TACC3, synergizes with paclitaxel to reduce tumor cell growth. We propose that the dependency on these gametogenic components may arise as a consequence of passage through a selection bottleneck, during tumor evolution, which requires acquisition of traits that normalize the mitotic perturbations originally driving the plasticity of preneoplastic genomes. We show that such traits, when defined by otherwise anomalous gene products, may represent conceptually ideal intervention targets with wide therapeutic windows.

N2  -  Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers and is characterized by early tissue invasion, metastasis and high resistance to systemic therapies. Gemcitabine, a standard cytotoxic therapy for pancreatic cancer, has shown limited clinical benefits. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), an approved treatment for breast cancer, has shown efficacy as mono- and combination therapy in multiple tumor types including pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer. We evaluated combination treatment benefits of nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine in experimental pancreatic cancer. Method(s): In vitro cell proliferation was evaluated by WST-1 assay in human PDAC cells. Animal survival studies were performed in murine xenografts. Result(s): Nab-paclitaxel inhibited in vitro proliferation of PDAC cell lines with IC50 levels of 7.6 mM, 208 nM, 519 nM and 526 nM for AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells. Nab-paclitaxel combination with gemcitabine had significant additive effect on inhibition of PDAC cell proliferation; 72-hour incubation demonstrated that nab-paclitaxel addition caused a 2.5, 2.5, 8.9 and 2.2-fold decrease in IC50 of gemcitabine in AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, respectively. In an intraperitoneal murine xenograft model, 2-week therapy demonstrated that compared to controls (median survival: 23 days), animal survival increased after gemcitabine (27 days, p=0.05) and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (35 days, p=0.0005). In a separate 3-week therapy experiment, animal survival was significantly longer in the nab-paclitaxel treated group (41 days, p<0.002 versus control and Gem) compared with gemcitabine (32 days, p=0.005 versus control), docetaxel (32 days, p=0.005) and controls (20 days). Animal survival in nab-paclitaxel / gemcitabine and docetaxel / gemcitabine sequential treatment group was 43 and 40 days, respectively. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel has significant antitumor activity as a single agent in experimental pancreatic cancer and can also enhance gemcitabine effects in combination. These findings provide a strong rationale for testing nab-paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic cancer.

N2  -  Background: With the aim of informing therapy-selection decisions for ovarian cancer patients, we have profiled tumors from 190 ovarian cancer patients since 2008 for expression of 25 biomarkers associated with drug response. For 48 patients with mature follow-up data, we asked how frequently the drugs designated as likely to be of clinical benefit based on the tumor profile were administered. Method(s): The tumor profiles and therapeutic choices of 48 patients that received a median of 2 (range 1-9) prior therapies for recurrent disease were extracted from our privacy-protected database. Protein levels of drug sensitivity (ER/PR, hormonal agents; TOPO1, topotecan/irinotecan (T-I); TOP2A, liposomal doxorubicin/etoposide (PLD-E); SPARC, nab-paclitaxel, N-P) and resistance (TS, pemetrexed/capecitabine (PC); RRM1, gemcitabine (G)) markers in each tumor were compared to expression in the ovarian cancer population to assign drugs likely to be associated with clinical benefit (values 25th percentile: sensitivity; 25th percentile: resistance). Result(s): A median of two drugs (range 1-5) were prioritized for each patient based on marker expression. 38 patients received one of the 6 drug classes evaluated by the profile. Of those 38, 22 (58%) received a therapy that correlated with the profile and 16 (42%) received drugs that were not prioritized by the profile. G and PLD were most frequently administered both before (68%) and after (48%) profiling but were supported by the tumor profile in only 40% (4/10: G) and 30% (3/10: PLD-E) of the cases. These frequencies are similar to the patient fraction (26-34%) in which those drugs were each prioritized by profiling, suggesting that the profile is not influencing therapy choice. In contrast, 11 of the 14 patients who received N-P, T-I, or hormonal agents had tumor profiles that prioritized those agents, a frequency of profile match to the treatment received that is higher than expected based on the patient fraction assigned to each therapy. Conclusion(s): These results require confirmation in a much larger study, but suggest that tumor profiling may guide clinical decision-making for some therapies, although frequently used drugs are often given regardless of the tumor profiling evidence.

N2  -  Background: The standard of care for patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer is treatment with non cross-resistant drugs. Carboplatin retreatment is usually not an option in the platinum resistant population. Weekly paclitaxel has been tried in recurrent patients. But paclitaxel can cause hypersensitivity reactions due to its Cremophor based solvent. nab-paclitaxel being a nano-particle albumin bound paclitaxel is devoid of this toxictity. Also, it is thought that nab-paclitaxel may have a higher intratumoral uptake leading to enhanced anti-tumor action. We looked at a regimen using weekly carboplatin with weekly nab-paclitaxel in platinum resistantrelapsed carcinoma ovary who had failed multiple lines of treatment. Method(s): We treated 10 patients with recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancer with measurable disease with nab-paclitaxel 100mg/m2 on days 1,8,15 with carboplatin at AUC 1.5 on days 1,8,15 intravenously, repeated every 28 days for 4 cycles. All patients had received 3 or more lines of chemotherapy for recurrent disease. We looked for response rate, progression free survival and toxicities. Result(s): Three patients had complete response, 5 patients had partial response and 2 patients had disease progression. Median PFS was 6 months. There were no instances of paclitaxel induced hypersensitivity reactions. Two patients developed grade 3 neutropenia. One patient developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Three patients required blood transfusions. One patient developed grade 3 neuropathy. Conclusion(s): Weekly combination of nab-paclitaxel with weekly carboplatin is a safe and potentially active treatment in recurrent platinum resistant ovarian cancers who had failed multiple lines of treatment. Considering the efficacy and favorable toxicity profile, this weekly combination needs to be tested in a larger number of patients.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer patients with an anti-tumor immune response have a prolonged survival, suggesting that augmenting anti-tumor immunity may be therapeutic. We hypothesized that weekly nab paclitaxel (nabP) followed by GM-CSF may enhance anti tumor immunity and prolong time to progression (TTP). Method(s): Eligible subjects had platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, and an elevated CA125. Conditional power estimate after 11 subjects showed 22 subjects had 80% power to show a response rate (RR) >21% if the true study RR is 35%. Study end points were RR and TTP. Progression (DP) was doubling of CA125 above the nadir. Complete response (CR) was a decline of CA125 below institutional normal. Partial response (PR) was a decline of >50% from baseline. Stable disease (SD) was all other scenarios. Subjects received nabP, 100mg/m2 days 1,8,15 followed by GM-CSF 250mcg days 16-26 of a 28 day cycle until progression or 6 cycles were complete. Responding subjects received up to 6 more cycles of GM-CSF on days 14-28. Result(s): 21 subjects received at least one dose of study medications. Median age was 61 (30-91) and had a median of 3 (1-13) prior regimens. Among those completing the study, the median TTP was 132 days vs. 272 days on the prior platinum regimen. 9/21 (43%) had a PR and 4/21 (19%) had a CR. Subjects with a response had a median TTP of 140 days. Assay of serial T-lymphocyte counts against CEA, MUC1, CA125 and tt and influenza controls are planned. Conclusion(s): Weekly nabP with GM-CSF had manageable toxicity and induced a high response rate (62% by CA125) in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, however this regimen did not prolong the TTP beyond the TTP observed in the prior platinum regimen.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol, Abraxane) is used in many regimens for breast, non-small-cell-lung and ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a candidate for dose management: multiple studies have demonstrated a greater than 10fold interpatient variability of clearance rates with BSA-based dosing, a pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic relationship has been demonstrated, and high exposure has been shown to be a good predictor of severe & febrile neutropenia which is experienced by > 90 % of all patients treated with PTX. The requirements to run physical methods limit their use in the clinical laboratory for PTX dose management. Aim(s): This study was undertaken to validate a PTX immu-noassay assay as a tool to identify and manage patients at high risk of suffering from extreme toxicity on regimens containing PTX. Method(s): A PTX immunoassay (MyPaclitaxelTM) developed at Saladax was used on the Beckman AU400/640 and Roche c111. Precision, accuracy and linearity were evaluated by CLSI protocols at four laboratories. Method comparison was done versus a validated HPLC-MS/MS method using samples (n=113) collected from patients on PTX therapy in accordance with an IRB approved protocol. Result(s): The following results were generated in our laboratory and verified at three external laboratories. Three controls and four patient pools were used in precision studies. Reproducibility CV was 2.2 % - 5.5 %, and within-laboratory CV 3.0 - 9.9 %. Linearity was demonstrated from 30 to 300 ng/mL. Lower limits of detection and quantitation were 11 and 19 ng/mL, respectively. The method comparison produced R200.9956 for the linear regression, with slope = 1.002 and intercept 0 -3.029. Cross-reactivity in the assay was <=5 % for co-administered drugs, <1 % for unrelated drugs, and <=3.4 % for major metabolites. Conclusion(s): The analytical performance of an automated immunoassay for PTX has been validated, providing a tool for the individualized dosing using PK-guided dose management.

N2  -  Objectives: Patient's survival is poor following a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The treatment includes aggressive surgery, removal of the tumor and resection of metastases with the goal of optimal surgical cytoreduction of tumor to <0.5cm before the administration of platinum-based chemotherapy. The majority of patients achieve a favorable clinical response, but most develop recurrent cancer. Some patients whose tumors are optimally debulked develop resistance to chemotherapy. In addition, a small minority of women whose tumors are suboptimally debulked are sensitive to chemotherapy and never relapse. These outcomes may be due to proteins variations and deficient drug metabolism enzymes. The object of this presentation is to highlight those variations and the molecular mechanisms which lead to paclitaxel resistance. Materials: Reagents for 2D-DIGE, Bradford assay kit, mouse anti human voltage dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 antibody, mouse anti human annexin V, clathrin heavy chain 1, ubiquitin protein ligase E1 antibodies, pan B tubulin by Covance, Cell lines and paclitaxel cytotoxicity, human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780, paclitaxel resistant OVCAR3, A2780TC1: a cell clone derived from A278, have been used. Method(s): Typhoon trio imager, In gel digestion, mass spectrometry, western blot and Ingenuity pathway analysis had been utilized to assess the proteins expression. Result(s): Laminin binding protein (Galectin-3), Tubulin beta, 4 variant Glycyl tRNA ligase, Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A Peroxiredoxin-2, Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 7 member A1, 26S protease regulatory subunit 8, Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 7 member A1, Peroxiredoxin-6, Tubulin beta chain, Nuclear matrix protein NMP 238, Alpha enolase, Cofilin (non muscle isoform), Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 13 Alpha enolase, Lamin A/C isoform CRA-b, Butyrophilin subfamily 2 member A1 precursor, Pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, Transketolase, Mitochondrial innermemberane proteins, H+ transporting two factor Atpase clathrin heavy chain 1, were identified as proteins expressed differentially between paclitaxel sensitive and resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. Conclusion(s): Proteomic profiling approach is proved to be an efficient tool for studying paclitaxel resistance in epithelial ovarian cancer cells by identification of proteins implicated in this phenomenon. This may lead to a possible molecular intevention to treat patients with paclitaxel resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to tumours that are ER, PR and HER2 negative on immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Treatment options for TNBC are limited due to lack of a therapeutic target and as a result is managed with standard chemotherapy such as paclitaxel [Taxol(R)]. Following chemotherapy, the ideal tumour response is apoptotic cell death. However, post-chemotherapy, cells can also maintain viability undergoing cellular senescence and viable autophagy, two forms of cellular fate. These cells represent highly chemo-refractory cellular populations generating secretomes which can directly impact on their surrounding tumour microenvironment (TME) enhancing the malignant phenotype. Moreover, we have demonstrated that downregulation of the mitotic assembly deficient protein (MAD2) through which paclitaxel exerts its apoptotic affect results in the induction of cellular senescence, demonstrable by increased p16 and beta galctosidase staining in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The purpose of this study is to determine the immunohistochemical levels of p16 and MAD2 in TNBC and associate the IHC outputs with grade, stage and subsequent chemoresponse. Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded sections from 45 TNBC have been staged, graded, sectioned and stained for p16 and MAD2 and IHC outputs will be presented in relation to subsequent chemoresponse. The ability to circumvent the induction of viable cellular fates and dysregulated apoptotic pathways post-chemotherapy is central to the design of novel therapies for TNBC, given that differential cellular fates limit the successfulness of therapy for this orphan cancer.

N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers and is characterized by early tissue invasion, metastasis and high resistance to systemic therapies. Gemcitabine, a standard cytotoxic therapy for pancreatic cancer, has shown limited clinical benefits. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane), an approved treatment for breast cancer, has shown efficacy as mono- and combination therapy in multiple tumor types including pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancer. We evaluated combination treatment benefits of nabpaclitaxel with gemcitabine in experimental pancreatic cancer. In vitro cell proliferation was evaluated by WST-1 assay in human PDAC cells. Animal survival studies were performed in AsPC-1 murine xenografts. Nabpaclitaxel inhibited in vitro proliferation of PDAC cell lines with IC50 levels of 7.6 muM, 208 nM, 519 nM and 526 nM for AsPC-1, BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells. Nab-paclitaxel combination with gemcitabine had significant additive effect on inhibition of PDAC cell proliferation; 72- hour incubation demonstrated that nab-paclitaxel addition caused a 2.5, 2.5, 8.9 and 2.2-fold decrease in IC50 of gemcitabine in AsPC-1, BxPC- 3, MIA PaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, respectively. In an intraperitoneal murine xenograft model, 2-week therapy demonstrated that compared to controls (median survival: 23 days), animal survival increased after gemcitabine (27 days, p=0.05) and nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (35 days, p=0.0005). In a separate 3-week therapy experiment, animal survival was significantly longer in the nab-paclitaxel treated group (41 days, p<0.002 versus control and Gem) compared with gemcitabine (32 days, p=0.005 versus control), docetaxel (32 days, p=0.005) and controls (20 days). Animal survival in nab-paclitaxel / gemcitabine and docetaxel / gemcitabine sequential treatment group was 43 and 40 days, respectively. Nab-paclitaxel has significant antitumor activity as a single agent in experimental pancreatic cancer and can also enhance gemcitabine effects in combination. These findings provide a strong rationale for testing nab-paclitaxel in patients with pancreatic cancer.

N2  -  Objective: This study examines publicly available gene expression profiles of Mullerian low grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) to identify differentially expressed genes and key pathways involved in carcinogenesis and chemotherapy response. Method(s): Previously published data of laser capture microdissected LGSC and HGSC, run on Affymetrix U133 plus2 gene chip microarray, were downloaded from GEO or through direct contact with the authors. Data were normalized using the RMA algorithm followed by an Empirical Bayes normalization methodology. Statistical testing and visualization was accomplished in the Genespring framework. The final dataset contained 27 LGSC and 44 HGSC from 4 groups. Differentially expressed genes were filtered (>80% expression) and subjected to a T-test with a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing FDR of p<.05. Result(s): Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed segregation of LGSC from HGSC. HGSC tumors previously classified as primary ovarian carcinoma or primary fallopian tube carcinoma clustered together irrespective of their designated origin. 475 probe sets were at least 2 fold different between the LGSC and HGSC-156 were up-regulated in the LGSC and 319 up-regulated in the HGSC. Gene Ontology (GO) categorization found 187 over-enriched categories in HGSC samples, predominantly related to cell cycle and immune response. Five over-enriched GO categories were found in LGSC, primarily in extracellular matrix classifications. LGSC were found to overexpress KLF4 and its target p21/WAF1 relative to HGSC. These proteins have both tumor suppressive and potentially oncogenic effects. Conclusion(s): Our findings support the hypothesis that serous Mullerian carcinoma may develop through two different pathways yielding two distinct malignancies-LGSC and HGSC. Furthermore, gene expression analyses demonstrated overexpression of KLF4 and p21/WAF1 in LGSC. The key role of these proteins in proliferation inhibition may contribute to the differential response of LGSC to standard chemotherapy. Similarly, a novel LGSC-associated gene, Clusterin, encodes for a secreted protein previously shown to prevent paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cell lines. Suppressing the levels of these proteins may increase clinical response to standard chemotherapy in patients with LGSC. In addition, the genetic profiles identified in this study may potentially be used in developing disease-specific, targeted therapy for LGSC and HGSC.

N2  -  Objective: To determine the effect of RNA interference with transferred pshRNA/PHB on the biological characteristics of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Method(s): Western blot and real time-PCR were used to assay the expression of PHB protein and mRNA in SKOV3/Taxol-25 and SKOV3 cell lines. The SKOV3/Taxol-25 cell lines were transiently transfected by 3 target-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference fragments with fluorescent protein named the pshRNA427/PHB1, pshRNA248/PHB2, and pshRNA 136/PHB3. The empty plasmid transfection via vehicle Lipofectamine2000 served as a negative control. The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA were detected by Western blot and real time-PCR after the transfection for 48 h. The silence effect of PHB1 and PHB3 groups was obvious. PHB1, PHB3, and the negative control groups were used for the following experiments. MTT and flow cytometry assay were used to test the cell proliferation, IC50 of paclitaxel, and cell apoptosis in the 3 groups. Result(s): The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA (2 -Ct) were significantly higher in SKOV3/Taxol-25 cell line than those in SKOV3 cell line (P<0.05). The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA were significantly lower in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups than those in the negative control group (P<0.05). The cell proliferations in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups were obviously slower than those in the negative control group after transfection for 48 h and 72 h (P<0.05). The IC50 of paclitaxel in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups significantly decreased after transfection for 72 h compared with the negative control group(P<0.05). The cell apoptotic rate in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups significantly increased after transfection for 48 h compared with the negative control group (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): The shRNA/PHB can effectively suppress the expression of PHB gene in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. The cell proliferation in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines with removed PHB gene is significantly reduced. The apoptotic rate and the paclitaxel sensitivity of resistant cell lines with removed PHB gene are significantly increased. PHB gene is related to paclitaxel-resistance and interfering PHB gene expression may reduce paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Objective: To determine whether silence of PKC-alpha expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) might regulate MDR1 expression and reverse chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. Method(s): We measured gene and protein expression of MDR1 and PKC-alpha in ovarian cancer cells and assessed their correlation with cell drug resistance. We also examined whether blocking PKC-alpha by RNA interference (RNAi) affected MDR1 expression and reversed drug resistance in drug sensitivity tests. Result(s): The drug resistance cell lines, OV1228/DDP and OV1228/Taxol, had higher gene and protein expression of MDR1 and PKC-alpha than their counterpart sensitive cell line, OV1228. SiRNA depressed PKC-alpha gene protein expression, as well as MDR1 and protein expression and improved the drug sensitivity in OV1228/DDP and OV1228/Taxol cells. Conclusion(s): These results indicated that decreasing PKC-alpha expression with siRNA might be an effective method to improve drug sensitivity in drug resistant cells with elevated levels of PKC-alpha and MDR1. A new siRNA-based therapeutic strategy targeting PKC-alpha gene could be designed to overcome the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Objective: To study the effect of the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K/Akt) inhibitor LY294002 during chemotherapy on the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780/Taxol. Method(s): The effect of treatment with LY294002 on A2780/Taxol cell lines was determined based on the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of paclitaxel, and on cell proliferation using the cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) assay. The apoptotic rates and cell cycle stages were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of PI3K/Akt, its phosphorylated form p-Akt, and phosphorylated P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein was analyzed using Western blot. Result(s): The CCK-8 results showed that the proliferation of A2780/Taxol cell lines after 24 h since being treated with LY294002 was significantly slower compared with the untreated A2780/Taxol cell lines. The IC50 of paclitaxel in A2780/Taxol cells treated with LY294002 was also significantly lower than that in the original A2780/Taxol cell line. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the apoptotic ratio of the experiment group was significantly higher than that of the control group. Both groups showed some changes in the cell cycle, and there were statistically significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). Phosphorylated Akt and P-gp protein levels in A2780/Taxol cells were inhibited by LY294002, compared with the untreated A2780/Taxol cells. Conclusion(s): The PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 has a reversal effect on the paclitaxel-resistance of the A2780/Taxol cell line.

N2  -  Clinical applications of advanced nanomedicines such as PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel-albumin bioconjugates have significantly improved the cancer treatment strategies. However, these pharmaceuticals lack early detection and single cell tracking capabilities. Thus, engineering of smart multifunctional theranostics appear to be our next step for simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of cancer. Clinical translation of multifunctional theranostics appears to be dependent upon specificity of cancer biomarkers, biocompatibility of components used for formulation, and advancement of bioconjugation techniques. While many cancer biomarker candidates often fail to be used for clinical diagnosis/therapy because of their nonspecific functional expression in normal tissues, biocompatibility of materials used for bioconjugation also needs to be approved. All these issues need to be fully addressed prior to the translation of smart multifunctional cancer theranostics. © 2011 by Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

N2  -  Microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), which include vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and the recently introduced epothilone, ixabepilone, are widely used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of patients with cancer. MTAs interfere with the normal structure and function of microtubules, leading to cell-cycle arrest and tumor cell death. Microtubule function is critical to normal neuronal function, thus MTA therapy is commonly associated with some form of neuropathy. There is poor agreement between tools for clinical assessment of MTA-associated peripheral neuropathy, and standardization of grading scales is needed to reduce variability. For a majority of patients, MTA-associated neuropathy is mild to moderate in intensity and reversible, but it can be severe and resolve incompletely. The incidence and severity of MTA-associated neuropathy is drug, dose, and schedule dependent. The first-generation vinca alkaloids (eg, vincristine) are associated with severe mixed sensory and motor neuropathy, whereas the newer vinca alkaloids (eg, vinorelbine, vinflunine) induce a milder sensory neuropathy. Taxane-associated sensory neuropathy occurs more often with standard (polyoxyethylated castor oil-based) and albumin-bound paclitaxel than with docetaxel. The incidence and presentation of peripheral neuropathy with ixabepilone, alone or in combination with capecitabine, are similar to that with taxanes. Management of neuropathy may involve reducing or delaying the MTA dose, or in severe persistent or disabling cases discontinuing treatment. Reversal of neuropathy after dosage intervention appears to be more rapid with ixabepilone than with other MTAs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer patients who mount an anti-tumor immune response enjoy a prolonged survival, suggesting that augmenting anti-tumor immunity may be therapeutic. We hypothesized that weekly nab paclitaxel (nabP) followed by the immune stimulant, GM-CSF may enhance anti tumor immunity and prolong time to progression (TTP). Method(s): Eligible subjects had platinum resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer, and an elevated CA125. Conditional power estimate after 11 subjects showed 22 subjects had 80% power to show an improved response rate (RR) if the true RR is 35%. Study end points were RR and TTP. Progression (DP) was doubling of CA125 above the nadir. Complete response (CR) was a decline of CA125 below institutional normal. Partial response (PR) was a decline of >50% from baseline. Stable disease (SD) was all other scenarios. Subjects received nabP, 100mg/m2 days 1,8,15 followed by GM-CSF (Leukine) 250mcg days 16-26 of a 28 day cycle until progression or 6 cycles were complete. Responding subjects received up to 6 more cycles of GM-CSF on days 14-28. Result(s): 20 subjects received at least one dose of study medications, 16 have completed the study. Median age was 62 (30-91) and had a median of 3 (1-13) prior regimens. Among those completing the study, the median TTP was 110 days vs. 269 days on the prior platinum regimen. 6/16 (37%) had a PR and 2/16 (13%) had a CR. Subjects with a response had a median TTP of 140 days. Toxicities were manageable. 3 subjects went off nabP due to progressive sensory neuropathy. 3 subjects had grade 3 neutropenia requiring dose delay and reduction. 3 subjects experienced grade 3 lymphopenia. One episode of grade 3 fatigue, hypokalemia, and anemia each occurred. One subject was hospitalized for bowel obstruction, another with bowel obstruction, esophagitis and hypoxia due to pleural effusion. Two subjects died while on study, one of a pulmonary embolism, another at home unattended, cause unknown. Conclusion(s): Weekly nabP with GM-CSF has manageable toxicity and induces a high response rate in patients with platinum resistant ovarian cancer, however this regimen does not prolong the TTP beyond the TTP observed in the prior platinum regimen.

N2  -  Background:Nab-paclitaxel (NP) is a solvent-free, albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation; it binds to albumin receptor on endothelial cells, which in turn activates caveolin-1. Lack of solvents and receptor-mediated delivery results in decreased toxicity and increased antitumor activity of NP. Tumors expressing SPARC, and albumin-binding protein may have increased efficacy of NP. In this study we evaluated paclitaxel (P) and NP toxicities; SPARC's role in NP sensitivity; intraperitoneal NP effect and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in mice with ovarian cancer. Method(s): Human ovarian cancer (OC) cell lines OVCAR-3, SKOV-3, AG-6000 and A-2780 were seeded in 96-well plates and after 24 hours (h) of seeding, varying concentrations of NP or P were added for 72 h, after which viability was evaluated by MTS assay. SPARC expression was determined in all 4 OC lines by Western blotting. In an in vivo study, intraperitoneal injections of NP were evaluated at different doses (50, 75, 100, and 125mg/Kg) on growth of tumors in mice with OC. Result(s): Mean IC50 (concentration of drug that inhibits 50% of cell growth) for A-2780 cell line treated with P vs. NP was 16.2 vs. 0.12 nM respectively (fold difference 131); for AG-6000 was 19 vs. 0.15 nM respectively (fold difference 124); for OVCAR-3 was 2.04 vs. 1.77 nM respectively (fold difference 1.15); and for SKOV-3 was 9.5 vs. 9.04 nM (fold difference 1.05). SPARC protein was present in cells (AG-6000 and A-2780) that were more sensitive to NP but not in OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 cell lines. All NP doses were well tolerated in mice with OC and no significant difference in post treatment recovery was noted. All mice had reduced activity and squinting for 1-1.5 hours post NP injection; and they all seemed anemic at the necroscopy. Conclusion(s): NP had higher cytotoxic effects compared to P in AG-6000 and A-2780 cell lines which directly correlated with higher SPARC expression in these two 2 cell lines. Intraperitoneal NP was well tolerated in an OC mouse model.

N2  -  Background: The efficacy of nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel (N) seems to correlate with the expression of tumor-associated SPARC. A common mechanism for SPARC downregulation is hypermethylation. This study investigates the use of the hypomethylating agent azacitadine (A), followed by N in the treatment of refractory advanced solid tumors. Method(s): Patients with evaluable advanced solid tumors, adequate organ function, PS 0-2, and unlimited prior cytotoxic regimens were eligible. Cohorts of 3-6 patients were enrolled and treated. Escalating doses of A (75-100 mg/m2) was administered to patients SC on days 1-5, followed by a fixed dose of N (100 mg/m2) on days 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. Serum and/or tissue samples, where appropriate, were collected for correlative studies. Result(s): Patients were initially permitted to have an unlimited number of prior chemotherapies, but after 2 of the first 5 patients experiencing DLT (grade 4 neutropenia > 8 days), and dose reduction of N occurring in 3 patients all with 4 or more prior cytotoxic regimens, the protocol was amended to permit no more than 2 prior cytotoxic regimens. Cohort 2 was treated at the same dose level (A 75mg/m2) with no DLT. Cohort 3 was treated at the next dose level (A 100 mg/m2). Two of 4 had DLT of prolonged grade 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the MTD of A in this regimen is 75 mg/m2. Three additional patients were treated at the MTD dose with no grade 4 toxicity in cycle 1. To date, 16 patients have enrolled in the phase I part. Two patients were removed before completing cycle 1 because of disease progression. One patient was removed after cycle 4 for noncompliance. Clinical activity included 1 CR in refractory DLBC lymphoma, 2 CR in ovarian cancer, 4PR in ovarian and endometrial cancer, 4 SD in lung, sarcoma and pancreatic cancer, 1 unconfirmed PR in breast cancer, and 1 PD in CLL/SLL. Two breast cancer patients in the phase II part had unconfirmed PR and are still receiving treatments. Conclusion(s): A 75 mg/m2 followed by weekly N 100 mg/m2 was well tolerated and seemed to result in dramatic responses in heavily pre-treated patients with cancer of diverse histology.

N2  -  Therapies for recurrent, advanced stage ovarian cancer are often empirically selected and associated with similarly poor response rates and short progression-free survivals. Our ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes by enabling a more rational selection of chemotherapies based upon individual tumor molecular profiles. To identify molecular markers to include in such profiling, we performed a literature search for evidence supporting the association between chemotherapy response markers and in vivo responses to drugs currently employed in ovarian cancer treatment. We found multiple reports that demonstrated a correlation between expression levels of RRM1, TOPO1, TOPO2, ERCC1, TS, MGMT, SPARC, MRP1, MDR1, or BCRP and clinical responses to gemcitabine, topoisomerase 1 and 2 inhibitors, platinum, fluoropyrimidines, temozolamide, nab-paclitaxel, taxanes, and other drugs. However, few studies addressed the correlation between these biomarkers and therapy responses for ovarian cancer patients. We therefore measured expression of these markers in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks (obtained following informed patient consent) by immunohistochemical analyses at CLIA-certified laboratories to establish expression characteristics of these proteins in epithelial ovarian carcinomas. Protein expression data were recorded as histoscores (% tumor cells stained x intensity). We profiled fifty-nine advanced stage ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers of which 42 were of either serous papillary histology or adenocarcinomas (25 primary and 17 recurrent serous ovarian tumor specimens). The first-line response to platinum-taxane therapy for most of these patients (23 sensitive, 7 resistant, 2 refractory) and BRCA1 and 2 mutation status (7 BRCA1 mutation carriers) were also known. Most of the marker proteins were heterogeneously expressed both within the tumor sample and across the cohort of patient tumors. The exceptions were TOPO2 and MDR1, which were poorly detected in most tumors. Interestingly, primary specimens had significantly lower expression levels of MDR1 and higher expression of RRM1 and TOPO1 than recurrent lesions underscoring the potential importance of determining the molecular profile of recurrent specimens. Six of the seven BRCA1 mutation carriers were sensitive to platinum-taxane treatment, but no significant association with platinum responsiveness was observed for expression of any of the measured proteins. These data provide a basis for establishing expression cutoff points for each marker to test hypotheses that correlate individual or combined marker expression profiles with responses to chemotherapy in prospective analyses. Profiling of recurrent specimens is recommended for future clinical trials to evaluate this approach to individualize cancer therapy.

N2  -  Aim: Since conventional paclitaxel formulation using Cremophor-ethanol (CrEL) associated with adverse effects, solvent- free formulations in the form of paclitaxel nanoparticles are recently developed so as to improve the therapeutic effectiveness and reduce the toxicity arisen from CrEL. The present study is to compare the cancer cell uptake kinetics of three paclitaxel formulations, including paclitaxel with CrEL, and solvent-free albumin-bound and polymer-based paclitaxel nanoparticles. Methodology: Three cell lines, MCF-7, A549 and OVCAR-3, representing human breast, lung and ovarian carcinoma respectively, were used in this study. Testing concentrations range and pH environment of the three formulations were evaluated by MTT test. Cellular uptake of the three paclitaxel formulations at three loading concentrations (high, medium and low of their determined concentration range) by the three target cells were assessed at various time intervals. The collected cell samples were extracted by methanol followed by analysis of paclitaxel content using a developed and validated LC/MS/MS method. The calculated percentage of cell uptake was compared between different loading concentrations/incubation times of the same formulation to investigate the effect of the incubation time/concentration on the cell uptake. In addition, cell uptake of the three formulations at same concentrations was compared to evaluate the impact of nanoparticles formulations on the cancer cell uptake of paclitaxel. Result(s): MTT tests indicated that <80% of the cells survive at pH 7.4 with 1-10 muM paclitaxel, while only less than 40% of the cells remained viable when pH reduced to 5-6. Cellular uptake for paclitaxel with CrEL showed that the percentage uptake of paclitaxel was found to less than 5% for both A549 and MCF-7. Increase of the loading concentrations from 5 muM to 10 muM did not significantly increase the uptake, however increase of the incubation time from 8 to 24 h could enhance the cellular uptake of paclitaxel when the pH remain the same. Consequently, loading concentration of 1-10 muM paclitaxel, pH 7.4 and incubation period up to 24 h were selected for subsequent cell uptake kinetic analysis of the three tested paclitaxel formulations. Our results showed that cellular uptake was generally enhanced in the two solvent-free paclitaxel nanoparticle formulations when compared to paclitaxel with CrEL, which accounts for ~2-3% uptake after 24 h incubation at 5 muM loading concentration. In addition, roles of cellular binding and drug release from the three formulations have also been evaluated to provide mechanistic explanations on the enhanced cellular uptake. Conclusion(s): Our results demonstrated that paclitaxel nanoparticles exhibit higher cellular uptake than CrEL containing formulation, suggesting that paclitaxel nanoparticles may achieve better therapeutic effects than its conventional formulation at similar dose. Further in vivo comparison would warrant its clinical impact.

N2  -  Background: The practical use of paclitaxel is sometimes limited by its poor aqueous solubility. Cremophor based formulation of paclitaxel (CP) is shown to be tolerated well in cancer patients, although it causes numerous side effects. Nanoparticle delivery systems are employed to improve the transport of paclitaxel to the target cells, and to increase the bioavailability inside the cells. Recently, a novel cremophor-free nanoparticle based paclitaxel (Nanoxel, NP) formulation has been developed by Fresenius Kabi Oncology Ltd, India and made available in some countries. This study aimed to compare the cellular uptake of NP and albumin bound paclitaxel (AP) with CP by various human cancer cell lines. Material(s) and Method(s): Human cancer cell lines, A549, HBL-100 and PA-1 representing non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer respectively were used in the study. The cells were treated with either drug (NP or AP or CP) corresponding to the final paclitaxel concentration of 10 muM or vehicle of NP and later on, studied under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Result(s): HPLC showed that percentage of paclitaxel uptake was significantly higher in NP or AP treated cells compared to CP treated cells (Table 1). TEM showed that NP and AP were internalized into the cancer cells by the process of endocytosis whereas CP was internalized by nonendocytic mechanism. Similar to NP, the vehicle of NP also penetrated into the cells through endocytosis. In addition, TEM evidence of mitochondrial damage was found only in CP, but not in AP or NP, treated cells. Conclusion(s): The penetration of NP and AP into the cancer cells was found to be significantly better than by CP. Furthermore, the evidence of cremophor-induced mitochondrial damage in CP, but not in NP and AP treated cells suggests that the NP and AP, may provide a benefit over CP by better delivering the drug to the tumour cells. (Table presented) *p < 0.001, indicates % of paclitaxel uptake was significantly higher than CP CP-cremophor based formulation of paclitaxel; AP- albumin bound paclitaxel; NP-nanoparticle based formulation of paclitaxel.

N2  -  Objectives: Conventional polyethoxylated castor oil (PCO)-based paclitaxel is associated with major adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Nanoxel, a nanoparticle-based formulation, may improve its tolerability by removing the need for PCO vehicle, and also permit its use in a higher dose. We conducted intensive monitoring of the ADR profile of Nanoxel in comparison with conventional paclitaxel in a public tertiary care set-up. Material(s) and Method(s): ADR data were collected from 10 patients receiving Nanoxel and 10 age-matched controls receiving conventional paclitaxel in this longitudinal observational study, conducted in a medical oncology ward over 18 months. Severity was graded as per US National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The groups had comparable demography at baseline. The median disease duration and per cycle median dose of paclitaxel were greater in the Nanoxel arm. Total 119 ADRs were noted with Nanoxel and 123 with conventional paclitaxel. Of these, 25 (21.0%, 95% CI 13.69-28.33%) in the Nanoxel and 20 (16.2%, 95% CI 9.74-22.78%) in paclitaxel group were of grade 3/4 severity. Common events included myalgia, nausea, anemia, paresthesia, alopecia, diarrhea, and vomiting with Nanoxel, and paresthesia, anemia, myalgia, anorexia, alopecia, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and nausea with paclitaxel. Of the less common events (<5%), grade 2 or 3 arthralgia was seen exclusively with Nanoxel while motor neuropathy with muscular weakness was more frequent and severe with conventional paclitaxel. Hypersensitivity reactions were not encountered in either arm, although no antiallergy premedication was employed for Nanoxel. Conclusion(s): Despite its ADR profile being statistically comparable to conventional paclitaxel, this observational study suggests that Nanoxel tolerability could be better, considering that a significantly higher dose was employed. This hypothesis needs confirmation through an interventional study.

N2  -  Nanoxel-PMTM, docetaxel-loaded methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA) micellar formulation was prepared in an effort to develop alternative, less toxic and efficacious Tween 80-free docetaxel formulation, and its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity were evaluated in comparison with Taxotere in preclinical studies. The mean diameter of the Nanoxel-PMTM was 10-50 nm and the polydispersity of samples exhibited a narrow size distribution and monodisperse unimodal pattern. Pharmacokinetic study in mice, rats and beagle dogs revealed that Nanoxel-PMTM exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles (Cmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, Vss) to Taxotere, and the relative mean AUCt and Cmax of Nanoxel-PMTM to Taxotere were within 80-120%. Furthermore, excretion study in rats demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the amount excreted in feces or urine as an unmetabolized docetaxel between Nanoxel-PMTM and Taxotere. Its pharmacokinetic bioequivalence resulted in comparable anti-tumor efficacy to Taxotere in human lung cancer xenografts H-460 in nude mice as well as in lung, ovary and breast cancer cell lines. Several animal toxicity studies on Nanoxel-PMTM compared with Taxotere were carried out. In single dose rat and dog model and repeated dose mouse model, both Nanoxel-PMTM and Taxotere exhibited similar toxic effects on hematology and body weight gain. On the other hand, vehicle related hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retentions were not observed when Nanoxel-PMTM was administered, unlike Taxotere, in the beagle dog study. Based on these results, it is expected that Nanoxel-PMTM can reduce side effects of hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention while retaining antitumor efficacy in cancer patients. Currently, Nanoxel-PMTM is under evaluation for bioequivalence with Taxotere in a multi-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Resistance to taxanes, related to limited efficacy of systemic therapy in cancer patients, is multifactorial. Among mechanisms of resistance to taxanes, those related to microtubule-associated proteins (MAP), including protein Tau, are of great importance. Protein Tau (50-64 kD) binds to beta-tubulin in the same place as paclitaxel. In preclinical studies, low expression of Tau in cancer cells was associated with increased sensitivity to paclitaxel. High expression of Tau protein in ER-positive breast cancers indicates resistance to taxane-containing chemotherapy and sensitivity to hormonal treatment. This article reviews current knowledge on predictive value of protein Tau in response to taxanes. Better understanding of its role may facilitate patients selection to this sort of treatment and lead to treatment optimization. © 2011 The Author(s).

N2  -  Multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer is a significant clinical obstacle and is often implicated in cases of recurrent, nonresponsive disease. Targeted nanoparticles were made by synthesizing a poly(D,L-lactide- co-glycolide)/ poly(ethylene glycol)/epidermal growth factor receptor targeting peptide (PLGA/PEG/ EGFR-peptide) construct for incorporation in poly(epsilon- caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles. MDR was induced in a panel of nine human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines using hypoxia. EGFR-targeted polymer blend nanoparticles were shown to actively target EGFR overexpressing cell lines, especially upon induction of hypoxia. The nanoparticles were capable of sustained drug release. Combination therapy with lonidamine and paclitaxel significantly improved the therapeutic index of both drugs. Treatment with a nanoparticle dose of 1 muM paclitaxel/10 muM lonidamine resulted in less than 10% cell viability for all hypoxic/MDR cell lines and less than 5% cell viability for all normoxic cell lines. Comparatively, treatment with 1 muM paclitaxel alone was the approximate IC50 value of the MDR cells while treatment with lonidamine alone had very little effect. The PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide delivery system actively targets a MDRcell by exploiting the expression of EGFR. This system treatsMDRby inhibiting the Warburg effect and promoting mitochondrial binding of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (lonidamine), while hyperstabilizing microtubules (paclitaxel). This nanocarrier system actively targets a MDR associated phenotype (EGFR receptor overexpression), further enhancing the therapeutic index of both drugs and potentiating the use of lonidamine/paclitaxel combination therapy in the treatment of MDR cancer. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

N2  -  Ixabepilone demonstrates marked synergistic activity in combination with capecitabine, which served as the rationale for the evaluation of this combination in the clinic. Ixabepilone plus capecitabine is currently approved for patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progressing after treatment with an anthracycline and a taxane; approval was based on the results of two phase III trials comparing the combination with capecitabine monotherapy. An array of preclinical studies in multiple solid tumor types show that ixabepilone demonstrates therapeutic synergy with targeted therapies including trastuzumab, bevacizumab, brivanib, and cetuximab; with immune-modulating agents such as anti-CTLA-4 antibody; and with other chemotherapy drugs such as irinotecan and epirubicin. Notably, experiments in several xenograft models show that ixabepilone provides greater antitumor synergism when combined with bevacizumab than either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab. These preclinical findings provide a foundation for ongoing phase II clinical trials using ixabepilone in combination with trastuzumab or lapatinib in HER2-positive breast cancer; with bevacizumab in breast cancer, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); with cetuximab in breast cancer, NSCLC, and pancreatic cancer; and with brivanib, dasatinib, sorafinib, sunitinib, or vorinostat in MBC. Preliminary results from several of these trials suggest that ixabepilone-based combinations have promising anticancer activity. © The Author(s), 2011.

N2  -  Paclitaxel and docetaxel are established as the standards of care, either as monotherapy or in combination with other cytotoxic agents in metastasic breast cancer. In order to improve the efficiency of solvent-based paclitaxel and to overcome its drawbacks in terms of safety, a solvent-free formulation has been developed. This work is a review of the albumin-bound paclitaxel data relative to its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles, its therapeutic efficiency and its safety of use. The activity of albumin-bound paclitaxel in phase II and III trials indicates its significant clinical efficiency in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In lung and pancreatic cancer and in melanoma, the use of albumin-bound paclitaxel leads to interesting results which require further investigations. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that albumin-bound paclitaxel is associated with a better tolerance compared to standard paclitaxel. © E.S.I.F.T. srl - Firenze.

N2  -  In the preclinical setting, phosphorylation and subsequent proteosomal degradation of the proapoptotic protein BIM confers resistance to paclitaxel in solid tumors with RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway activation. Concurrent administration of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib enables paclitaxel-induced BIM accumulation, restoring cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and producing tumor regression in mice in vivo. A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel and bortezomib combinatorial treatment. Sixteen patients with refractory solid tumors commonly exhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation were treated weekly with paclitaxel and bortezomib. Starting doses were 40 mg/m2 for paclitaxel and 0.7 mg/m2 for bortezomib. A modified continual reassessment method adapted for 2-drug escalation was used for MTD determination with 3-patient cohorts treated at each dose level. MTD was reached at 60 mg/m2 paclitaxel and 1.0 mg/m2 bortezomib, the recommended phase II dose. Therapy was overall well tolerated. Most frequently observed toxicities included anemia (in 43.75% of patients, one grade 3 event), fatigue (in 43.75% of patients, one grade 3 event beyond cycle 1), and neuropathy (in 31.25% of patients, one grade 3 event after cycle 1). Of 15 evaluable patients, one non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient with paclitaxel exposure at the adjuvant setting had a partial response and five patients had stable disease (SD); median disease stabilization was 143.5 days; three NSCLC patients had SD lasting 165 days or longer. Thus, rationally designed weekly treatment with paclitaxel and bortezomib in solid tumors with MAPK pathway activation, including previously taxane-treated malignancies, is a tolerable regimen with preliminary signals of antitumor activity worthy of further investigation. ©2011 AACR.

N2  -  Nanoxel-PM, docetaxel-loaded methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L- lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA) micellar formulation was prepared in an effort to develop alternative, less toxic and efficacious Tween 80- free docetaxel formulation, and its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity were evaluated in comparison with Taxotere in preclinical studies. The mean diameter of the Nanoxel-PM was 10-50 nm and the polydispersity of samples exhibited a narrow size distribution and monodisperse unimodal pattern. Pharmacokinetic study in mice, rats and beagle dogs revealed that Nanoxel-PM exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles (Cmax, AUC, t1/2, CL, Vss) to Taxotere, and the relative mean AUCt and Cmax of Nanoxel-PM to Taxotere were within 80-120%. Furthermore, excretion study in rats demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the amount excreted in feces or urine as an unmetabolized docetaxel between Nanoxel-PMand Taxotere. Its pharmacokinetic bioequivalence resulted in comparable anti-tumor efficacy to Taxotere in human lung cancer xenografts H-460 in nude mice as well as in lung, ovary and breast cancer cell lines. Several animal toxicity studies on Nanoxel-PMcompared with Taxotere were carried out. In single dose rat and dog model and repeated dose mouse model, both Nanoxel-PM and Taxotere exhibited similar toxic effects on hematology and body weight gain. On the other hand, vehicle related hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retentions were not observed when Nanoxel-PM was administered, unlike Taxotere, in the beagle dog study. Based on these results, it is expected that Nanoxel-PM can reduce side effects of hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention while retaining antitumor efficacy in cancer patients. Currently, Nanoxel-PM is under evaluation for bioequivalence with Taxotere in a multi-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Because liver involvement in patients with metastatic cancer has limited options and poor outcomes, we conducted a phase I study to determine the safety, activity, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of hepatic arterial infusion of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (HAI nab-paclitaxel). Cohorts of three patients having predominant hepatic metastases received HAI nab-paclitaxel at three dose levels (180, 220, and 260 mg/m2, respectively) infused for more than 1 hour every 3 weeks (3 + 3 design). Some patients participated in comparative pharmacokinetic studies (i.v. vs. HAI), receiving their first course i.v., to determine peak concentrations and effect of first-pass hepatic extraction compared with subsequent courses administered by HAI. The highest dose level was expanded to determine the safety and activity of HAI nabpaclitaxel. Thirty-eight patients were treated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities at doses up to 260 mg/m2. Common adverse events included alopecia, fatigue, myelosuppresion, nausea, and vomiting. Three patients had stable disease for 4 or more months and 2 patients (1 of 12 with breast cancer and 1 of 1 with cervical cancer) achieved a partial response lasting for 5 and 15 months, respectively. Peak concentrations were lower (~50%) with greater hepatic extraction of drug (~42%) following HAI than i.v. infusion based on area under the curve comparison of drug exposure. HAI nab-paclitaxel showed partial hepatic extraction. At doses 260 mg/m2 or less given for 1 hour every 3 weeks, the treatment was well-tolerated and showed activity in advanced cancer patients with predominant liver metastases. ©2011 AACR.

N2  -  Background: Nab-paclitaxel is a novel Cremophor-free nanoparticle of albumin-stabilized paclitaxel, which has favorable efficacy and toxicity characteristics relative to other solvent-based taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel. Method(s): Eligible patients had platinum- and taxane-resistant ovarian cancer, defined by persistent or progressive disease following primary chemotherapy (n = 5) or recurrence within 6 months of treatment completion (n = 42). All patients had measurable disease, no prior therapy for recurrent disease and Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of <= 2. Treatment was nab-paclitaxel, 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28-day schedule. The primary endpoint was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0 response rate, evaluated in a 2-stage design (with power of 0.90 for a RR of 25% and with alpha of 0.05 for RR of 10%). Result(s): Fifty-one patients were enrolled of which 47 were evaluable; median time from frontline therapy completion to registration was 21 days. Patient demographics include median age: 59 (34-78) years, serous histology: 72%, and high-grade: 81%. Efficacy: one complete and 10 partial responses were confirmed (23%); 17 patients (36%) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 4.5 months (95% CI: 2.2-6.7); overall survival was 17.4 months (95% CI: 13.2-20.8). Seventeen patients (36%) had PFS >6 months. Toxicity: there were no grade 4 events; grade 3 events were neutropenia (6), anemia (3), GI (2), metabolic (2), pain (2), and leukopenia (1); neurosensory toxicity was observed as grade 2:5, grade 3:1. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel has noteworthy single-agent activity and is tolerable in this cohort of refractory ovarian cancer patients previously treated with paclitaxel. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  We have developed a well-defined and biocompatible amphiphilic telodendrimer system (PEG-b-dendritic oligo-cholic acid) which can self-assemble into multifunctional micelles in aqueous solution for efficient delivery of hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel. In this telodendrimer system, cholic acid is essential for the formation of stable micelles with high drug loading capacity, owing to its facial amphiphilicity. A series of telodendrimers with variable length of PEG chain and number of cholic acid in the dendritic blocks were synthesized. The structure and molecular weight of each of these telodendrimers were characterized, and their critical micellization concentration (CMC), drug-loading properties, particle sizes, and cytotoxicity were examined and evaluated for further optimization for anticancer drug delivery. The sizes of the micelles, with and without paclitaxel loading, could be tuned from 11.5 to 21 nm and from 15 to 141 nm, respectively. Optical imaging studies in xenograft models demonstrated preferential uptake of the smaller paclitaxel-loaded micelles (17-60 nm) by the tumor and the larger micelles (150 nm) by the liver and lung. The toxicity and antitumor efficacy profiles of these paclitaxel-loaded micelles in xenograft models were found to be superior to those of Taxol and Abraxane. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

N2  -  Taxanes are chemotherapeutic agents with a large spectrum of antitumor activity when used as monotherapy or in combination regimens. Paclitaxel and docetaxel have poor solubility and require a complex solvent system for their commercial formulation, Cremophor EL (CrEL) and Tween 80 respectively. Both these biological surfactants have recently been implicated as contributing not only to the hypersensitivity reactions, but also to the degree of peripheral neurotoxicity and myelosuppression, and may antagonize the cytotoxicity. Nab-paclitaxel, or nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABI-007; Abraxane), is a novel formulation of paclitaxel that does not employ the CrEL solvent system. Nab-paclitaxel demonstrates greater efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared with standard paclitaxel in patients with advanced disease (breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer). Clinical studies in breast cancer have shown that nab-paclitaxel is significantly more effective than standard paclitaxel in terms of overall objective response rate (ORR) and time to progression. Nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, capecitabine or bevacizumab has been shown to be very active in patients with advanced breast cancer. An economic analysis showed that nab-paclitaxel would be an economically reasonable alternative to docetaxel or standard paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer. Favorable tumor ORR and manageable toxicities have been reported for nab-paclitaxel as monotherapy or in combination treatment in advanced breast cancer. © 2009 Di Costanzo et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

N2  -  Taxanes are very effective agents in several types of cancer. However, their activity is counterbalanced by side effects that could represent a limitation of their use in older cancer patients. This review aims at evaluating whether or not there are data supporting a tailored use of standard taxanes i.e. docetaxel and paclitaxel in elderly patients with the aim to increase their therapeutic index. In addition, recent data on the role of nanoparticle albumine-bound paclitaxel in breast cancer are discussed in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Purpose Patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer have limited therapeutic options. There are no reports of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. We report efficacy and toxicity with nab-paclitaxel in this group. Patients and Methods Forty-seven patients enrolled (44 assessable patients). Main inclusion criteria were histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum (any stage, grade 2 to 3 if stage I) and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or elevated CA-125 (> 70 U/mL) in patients without measurable disease. Patients received nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 administered intravenously for 30 minutes on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for six cycles or until disease progression. Results Median age was 65.5 years; 76% of patients had stage IIIC or IV disease, 81% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and 94% had prior surgery. For assessable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 64% (15 complete responses [CR] and 13 partial responses [PR] among 44 assessable patients). In patients evaluated with RECIST only, the ORR was 45% (one CR and four PR of 11 patients). In patients with only elevated CA-125, ORR was 82% (seven CRs and two PRs of 11 patients). In patients meeting both RECIST and CA-125 criteria, the ORR was 64% (seven CRs and seven PRs of 22 patients). Median time to response was 1.3 months (range, 0.5 to 4.8 months). Estimated median progression-free survival was 8.5 months. The most frequent grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities were neutropenia (24%) and neuropathy (9%). Conclusion Nab-paclitaxel is active in this group of patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The ORR was 64%. Toxicities were manageable. Further studies of nab-paclitaxel in combination with platinum are warranted. © 2009 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel is used in the treatment of most gynecologic malignancies. It is solubilized in Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated castor oil agent responsible for the high rate of paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reactions. Abraxane, a newer, CremophorYfree form of albumin bound paclitaxel has demonstrated an activity and an improved toxicity profile in breast and lung cancers. Case Reports: Five patients with gynecologic cancers (2 ovarian, 2 endometrial, and 1 cervical malignancy) received Abraxane after having a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel. All five patients tolerated Abraxane well, experiencing no reactions or major side effects to the drug. Discussion(s): Abraxane is well tolerated in women with gynecologic cancer who have experienced a paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reaction. Further studies are ongoing to determine the clinical activity of Abraxane in the treatment of these malignancies. Copyright © 2009 by IGCS and ESGO.

N2  -  We have developed a nanocarrier drug-delivery system based on micelles formed by a new class of well-defined linear PEGylated two-arm oligomer of cholic acids in aqueous solution. By varying the length of the linear PEG chains and the configuration of cholic acid oligomer, one can easily fine-tune the physicochemical properties of the amphiphilic polymers and the resulting micelles. These include particle size, critical micelle concentration, and drug-loading capacity. High level of hydrophobic anticancer drugs such as PTX, etoposide and SN-38 can be readily loaded into such nanocarriers. The loading capacity of the nanocarrier for PTX (PTX) is extremely high (12.0mg/mL), which is equivalent to 37.5% (w/w) of the total mass of the micelle. PTX-loaded nanocarriers are much more stable than Abraxane (PTX/human serum albumin nanoaggregate) when stored in bovine serum albumin solution or dog plasma. PTX release profile from the micelles is burst-free and sustained over a period of seven days. The anti-tumor activity of PTX-loaded nanocarriers against ovarian cancer cell line in vitro, with continuous drug exposure, is similar to Taxol (formulation of PTX dissolved in Cremophor EL and ethanol) or Abraxane. Targeted drug delivery to tumor site with these novel micelles was demonstrated by near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in nude mice bearing ovarian cancer xenograft. Furthermore, PTX-loaded nanocarriers demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to Taxol at equivalent PTX dose in ovarian cancer xenograft model. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Objective: To study the proteins related to paclitaxel-resistant of ovarian cancer cell line. Method(s): The total proteins of paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell lines were separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using image analysis software. The differential proteins were identified using matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Western blot was used to determine the differential expression levels of the 2 proteins. Result(s): Forty differentially expressed proteins were found by image analysis software, and 24 differential proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. These proteins included proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nm23, prohibitin (PHB), annexin, alpha-enolase, heat shock protein (HSP), and so on. Conclusion(s): Twenty-four proteins in human ovarian cancer cell lines of paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive are found by proteomic techniques, which may be involved in the paclitaxel-resistance of human ovarian cancer cells.

N2  -  Objective: Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone for treatment of ovarian cancer, some patients are resistant to the treatment and will therefore not benefit from the standard platinum-based chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential use of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme (ERCC1) as a molecular predictor of clinical resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Excision repair crosscomplementation group 1 enzyme is a key enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair pathway which is involved in the DNA repair mechanisms in tumor cells damaged by treatment with platinum agents. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate if immunohistochemical expression of ERCC1 protein was associated with resistance to standard combination carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients. Method(s): Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 101 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer were used for immunohistochemical staining for the ERCC1 protein. All patients received carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy. Result(s): Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme protein overexpression was found in 13.9% of the tumors. Platinum resistance was found in 75% of the tumors with positive ERCC1 protein expression compared with 27% among the patients with negative tumor staining for ERCC1 (P = 0.0013). These findings translated into a significant difference in progression-free survival in both univariate (P = 0.0012) and in multivariate analysis (P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): The data presented suggest a positive association between positive ERCC1 protein expression and clinical resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. ©2009 by IGCS and ESGO.

N2  -  Aberrations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors frequently affect the activity of critical signal transduction pathways. To analyze systematically the relationship between the activation status of protein networks and other characteristics of cancer cells, we did reverse phase protein array (RPPA) profiling of the NCI60 cell lines for total protein expression and activation-specific markers of critical signaling pathways. To extend the scope of the study, we merged those data with previously published RPPA results for the NCI60. Integrative analysis of the expanded RPPA data set revealed five major clusters of cell lines and five principal proteomic signatures. Comparison of mutations in the NCI60 cell lines with patterns of protein expression showed significant associations for PTEN, PIK3CA, BRAF, and APC mutations with proteomic clusters. PIK3CA and PTEN mutation enrichment were not cell lineage-specific but were associated with dominant yet distinct groups of proteins. The five RPPA-defined clusters were strongly associated with sensitivity to standard anticancer agents. RPPA analysis identified 27 protein features significantly associated with sensitivity to paclitaxel. The functional status of those proteins was interrogated in a paclitaxel whole genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library synthetic lethality screen and confirmed the predicted associations with drug sensitivity. These studies expand our understanding of the activation status of protein networks in the NCI60 cancer cell lines, demonstrate the importance of the direct study of protein expression and activation, and provide a basis for further studies integrating the information with other molecular and pharmacological characteristics of cancer. ©2010 AACR.

N2  -  Background - Development of drug resistance is considered to be one of the most challenging issues in chemotherapy for cancer patients. As one of the conventional chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel was originally extracted from Pacific yew tree and has been applied widely in ovarian cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. Resistance to paclitaxel has posed severe problems in cancer treatment. We are therefore interested in identifying the genes that render paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer cells to become more sensitive with the drug treatment. The mechanisms and signaling pathways of these kinases in relations to paclitaxel resistance and their molecular targets have been investigated. Methods - We have screened a shRNA library containing 592 novel kinase genes with 1306 clones for the chemosensitizer loci. DNA was extracted in a high throughput manner, and cell transfection/transduction was carried out on 384 well plates using a unique solid-phase DNA delivery method. The positive hits were selected according to the alteration on their IC50 values for the drug using cell viability assays. Quantitative PCR, Western blot, and caspase assays have been employed to elucidate the signaling pathways of these kinases in response to paclitaxel. Protein purification and interaction studies have also been carried out in attempt to elucidate the putative substrates for the kinases and their interaction partners. Results and Conclusions - We have established a high throughput screening platform for identification of the chemosensitizer loci. High transfection/transduction efficiencies can be achieved using our solid-phase gene delivery method. Several novel unknown kinase genes that render drug-resistant cancer cells to become sensitive have been selected. The positive shRNA hits were further verified by quantitative real-time PCR. Among the 20 hits that showed diminished IC50 values of paclitaxel in breast cancer cells, we have selected two candidates for further studies. Knocking down of TAOK3 or VRK3 in breast cancer cells resulted in reduction of IC50 of paclitaxel to half of the original value. Furthermore, we have investigated the signaling pathways of these 2 kinases in relation to paclitaxel resistance. The different signaling pathways elucidated have revealed the complex nature of drug resistance development in cancer cells.

N2  -  Objective: We recently demonstrated that metronomically dosed topotecan elicits antiangiogenic effects by downregulating the potent proangiogenic factor HIF-1alpha. As metronomic paclitaxel appears to act via a different mechanism, we hypothesized that combined metro- nomic delivery of these agents would result in enhanced antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in an orthotopic mouse model of advanced ovarian cancer. Method(s): We examined the in vitro and in vivo effects of abraxane (microalbuminized paclitaxel) and topotecan given at either maxi- mum tolerated dose (MTD) or metronomic dosing in ovarian cancer models. For in vivo studies, we examined markers of cell proliferation (Ki-67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) after tumors were harvested. Result(s): In vitro cytotoxicity assays with HeyA8 tumor cells showed an IC50 of ~40 nMwhen treated with MTD abraxane. In contrast, the IC50 of metronomically dosed abraxane was ~10-20 nM (Pb 0.05). After in vivo dose-finding studies established the therapeuticmetronomic dose of abraxane, extensive therapy experiments with chemosensitive (HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1) tumor models demonstrated that metronomic abraxane reduced tumor growth by at least 85% compared with controls (Pb 0.01). In the SKOV3ip1model,metronomic abraxane alone resulted in a 64% reduction in tumor growth compared with metronomic topotecan alone (Pb 0.01). In the chemoresistant HeyA8-MDR model, abraxane and topotecan (both metronomically dosed) significantly reduced tumor weights by 40% when compared with controls (P= 0.01). Abraxane alone and combined with topotecan significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation tob1% versus controls (34%) (Pb 0.001). Metronomic abraxane treatment in the taxane-resistant model elicited a 50% decrease in angiogenesis as determined by microvessel density and CD31 staining compared with control animals and topotecan- treated animals (P < 0.01). Protracted low-dose abraxane exposure of HeyA8 cells markedly increased tumor cell expression of the angiogen- esis inhibitor thrombospondin-1. Increases in apoptosis were seen among animals treated with topotecan alone compared with vehicle- and abraxane-treated animals (Pb 0.01). Conclusion(s): Metronomically delivered topotecan and paclitaxel have complementary antiangiogenic effects in ovarian carcinoma because of their unique mechanisms of action. Given the safety and tolerance of metronomic regimens, this combination is attractive and should be considered for further development.

N2  -  Background: Paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin is effective salvage therapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antitumor activity of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus carboplatin in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Method(s): Patients with measurable disease received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle and carboplatin AUC 5 intravenously on day 1. Patients were to be treated for at least 6 cycles. Efficacy was measured by objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years. Result(s): Forty eligible patients with median age of 62 years (range 43 - 81) were enrolled; 28 patients had ovarian cancer stage IIIC, 9 had stage IIB/IIIB or IIC, and 3 had stage IV disease. Most were Caucasian (83%), most had ECOG status of 0 (88%), and all had received prior taxane/platinum chemotherapies. The median (standard deviation [STDV]) platinum-free interval was 13 (8) months. The median number of cycles with nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin was 6 (range 3-48). Of 38 patients who were evaluable (2 did not receive treatment), 15 (39%) had a complete response (CR), 15 (39%) had a partial response (PR) for an ORR of 79%. Seven (18%) patients had stable disease (SD), 1 (3%) patient had disease progression (PD). The median (STDV) PFS was 13 (11) months and median (STDV) OS was 30 (13) months. The most common grade >=3 adverse events were neutropenia (43%), fatigue (33%), hypersensitivity reaction to carboplatin (18%), anemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (5%), and nausea (5%). Of the 40 patients enrolled, 11 patients have completed 2 years of follow-up, 15 patients have died, 13 patients are still being followed, and 1 patient is still receiving treatment after more than 2 years. Conclusion(s): With a 97% disease control rate (CR + PR + SD), the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin had significant antitumor activity and was reasonably tolerated in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Background: Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane, ABX) is a novel cremophor-free nanoparticle of albumin-stabilized paclitaxel, which has favorable efficacy and toxicity characteristics relative to other solvent-based taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, and is currently approved for recurrent breast cancer. This is the first report of weekly abraxane in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer (OC). Method(s): Eligible patients had OC, that was persistent (n = 5) or progressed within 6 months of completion (n = 42) of primary platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients were required to have measurable disease, no prior therapy for recurrent disease and GOG performance status of <=2. Treatment was ABX 100 mg/m2 days 1,8,15 on a 28-day schedule. The primary endpoint was RECIST response rate (RR), evaluated in a 2-stage design (with power of 0.90 for a RR of 25% and with alpha of 0.05 for RR of 10%). Result(s): 51 patients were enrolled, of which 47 are evaluable; median time from frontline therapy completion to registration was just 21 days. Patient demographics include median age: 59 (34-78) years, primary site ovary: 87%, serous histology: 72%, and high-grade: 81%. All patients had measurable disease, one prior chemotherapy regimen and prior surgery. Efficacy: partial response was confirmed in 11 patients (23%); 17 patients (36%) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.5 months (95%CI: 2.1-6.7); overall survival was 17.4 months (95%CI: 12.5, not estimable). 17 patients (36%) had PFS > 6 months. Toxicity: there were no grade 4 events; grade 3 events were neutropenia (6), anemia (3), GI (2), metabolic (2), pain (2), and leukopenia (1); neurosensory toxicity was observed as grade 2: 5; and grade 3: 1. Conclusion(s): ABX appears to have substantial single-agent activity and to be tolerable in this cohort of highly refractory ovarian cancer patients previously treated with paclitaxel, and further investigation is warranted.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality of all cancers involving the female genital tract. Platinum-based therapy is standard primary treatment. Treatments to extend survival, while preserving quality of life, are needed for platinum-resistant patients where current treatment options yield < 4 months progression free survival (PFS) and < 10 months overall survival (OS). This study evaluates the combination of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) with bevacizumab in platinum-resistant patients. Method(s): 48 patients who had recurrent platinum-resistant OC (93.7%) or primary peritoneal carcinoma with measurable disease (by CT/MRI) were enrolled. 19 (40%) patients had one prior regimen, 27 (56%) had two prior regimens, and 2 (4%) patients had more than two prior regimens. All patients received nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV given on days 1 and 15 every 28 days, and were treated until progression. Result(s): Mean age was 61 (range 38-87 years) and patients were ECOG 0 (45.8%) or 1 (54.2%) at the time of enrollment. The median PFS, with 37 of 48 patients having experienced disease progression or death, was 8.3 months. Median OS was 16.5 months. Best overall response for the 39 patients who have completed the study to date: partial response: 18 (46.1%); stable disease: 12 (30.8%), progressive disease: 8 (20.5%), and not evaluable: 1 (2.6%). The rate of adverse events was low with 10% of the events reported as grade 3 or 4 toxicities. The most common hematological toxicities were neutropenia (2.6%) and anemia (2.4 %). The most common non-hematological toxicities were nausea (3.8%), nosebleed (3.8%), neuropathy (2.8%) and infection (1.6%). Bowel obstruction occurred in 3.8% of patients. Conclusion(s): nab-Paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 in combination with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15 every 28 days appears to be highly active with impressive PFS and OS combined with low G3/G4 toxicity. Further prospective trials should be explored in this population.

N2  -  Background: Previous studies with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) have demonstrated tumor regressions in patients with refractory cancer and predominant liver metastases. We therefore performed a phase I trial to ascertain tolerance and activity of HAI nab-paclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel). Method(s): Cohorts of 3-6 patients with predominant hepatic metastases with serum bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL received an escalating dose of HAI of nab-paclitaxel (ranging from 180 mg/m2 to 260 mg/m2 over 1 hour) once every 3 weeks (q3w). Some patients received a first course administered IV for pharmacokinetic comparison in individuals with paired studies (IV versus HAI) in order to determine peak concentrations and the effect of first-pass hepatic extraction. Result(s): Of 35 enrolled patients, toxicities and responses were evaluated at 3 dose levels and at dose expansion. DLT was not observed and the patients tolerated the treatment well. Common adverse events included alopecia, fatigue, myelosuppresion, nausea, and vomiting. Two (5.7%) patients achieved a PR (1 cervical cancer, 18+ cycles, n=1; and 1 breast cancer, 7 cycles, n=12) and 3 (8.6%) achieved SD (1 esophageal cancer, 10+ cycles, n=3; 1 ovarian cancer, 7 cycles, n=1; and 1 carcinoid tumor, 9 cycles, n=1). Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed lower peak concentrations (about 50%) with greater hepatic extract (about 41%) by the use of HAI nab-paclitaxel when compared to IV nab-paclitaxel. Conclusion(s): HAI nab-paclitaxel at < 260 mg/m2 q3w was well tolerated with 5 patients (14.3%) achieving SD or PR. Pharmacokinetics showed saturated hepatic extract at the dose level for 1 hour as described in this trial. Studies are ongoing to determine if levels of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) correlate with responses. Because of excellent tolerance, further study with increased dosages of HAI nab-paclitaxel, with prolonged infusion time up to 24 hours for greater hepatic extract, as well as in combination with other agents, may be worthwhile.

N2  -  A significant challenge in women's health is the persistence of multidrug resistant (MDR) breast and ovarian cancer which often leads to aggressive, metastatic cancer that is non-responsive to common chemotherapeutic agents. These MDR cells often resort to high levels of aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect). The Warburg effect is employed as a survival mechanism; less oxidative phosphorylation leads to less ROS damage, faster energy acquisition allows rapid growth, and decreased oxygen dependence allows survival during the dynamic vascularization states of a tumor. Fluctuating states of hypoxia and normoxia result from the combined processes of tumor expansion, vasculature destruction/obstruction, and angiogenesis. The current research clarifies the role of a hypoxic microenvironment in transforming breast and ovarian cancer into MDR cancer. A complex phenotype transformation occurs after hypoxic exposure that emulates MDR profiles; upregulated proteins include markers of MDR (such as the multidrug efflux pump P-glycoprotein), HIF-1alpha, EGFR, and Glut-1. Polymer blend nanoparticles capable of co-administering a common chemotherapeutic agent (paclitaxel) and an agent that exploits the Warburg Effect (lonidamine) were formulated for the treatment of MDR cancer. Lonidamine is a hexokinase II inhibitor; hexokinase II is a mitochondrial-associated isoform of the ATP dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis. Paclitaxel and lonidamine loaded poly(epsilon caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles were prepared using a solvent displacement method. Amine-poly(ethylene glycol) PEG (MW 2000) was grafted onto NHS activated 50:50 poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and this PLGA-PEG construct was incorporated in the nanocarriers to achieve surface modification with PEG. Treating normoxic and hypoxic cancer cells with lonidamine alone has very little effect below a 100 muM dose. Combination treatment with lonidamine and paclitaxel loaded PLGA-PEG/PCL nanoparticles enhances the cell kill of both agents in multiple breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. This formulation may be the foundation for a clinically viable treatment for MDR cancer.

N2  -  The taxanes are widely used in the cytotoxic treatment of many solid tumours. Their optimal scheduling, however, remains unconfirmed. Here we review the development of both paclitaxel and docetaxel to identify evidence influencing the choice of schedule. Early work with paclitaxel identified that it exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics which has important clinical implications. Paclitaxel has been administered with a wide range of infusion times, especially 3-weekly and recently weekly schedules. Clinical activity of a weekly schedule appears at least non-inferior, and, in certain circumstances superior, to the 3-weekly schedule, with improved tolerability. Similarly, docetaxel has been investigated for 3-weekly versus weekly schedule, reporting equivalent efficacy and improved side effect profile for weekly dosing with regards myelosuppression. Both paclitaxel and docetaxel are often used with the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and bevacizumab. It would appear that in this setting, activity may be again improved by administering the taxane weekly, especially in combination with trastuzumab. A further recent development is the use of nab-paclitaxel, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel; this Cremaphor EC-free preparation allows shorter infusion times without premedication. Benefits of a weekly schedule with this newer drug are also emerging from the limited randomised data. Whether the possibly greater efficacy of weekly paclitaxel in particular reflects a biological effect of more frequent exposure of cancer cells to the cytotoxic is less clear as this schedule also allows a higher dose intensity to be delivered. Nevertheless, after more than 20 years, weekly administration has emerged as the optimal schedule, especially for paclitaxel. In practice, the choice of schedule is a balance between the better tolerability (and possibly efficacy) of weekly treatment balanced against the inconvenience for both the patient and clinic of more frequent visits for chemotherapy. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To establish a taxol-resistance cell line of human ovarian carcinoma (OV1228/taxol), and investigate its biological features. METHOD(S): With the sensitive OV1228 human ovarian cancer cell line as the parental cells, taxol-resistant cell line of human ovarian cancer (OV1228/taxol) was established by continuous stepwise selection in the increasing concentration of taxol. Cell morphology, growth curve and population doubling time, drug sensitivity, cell cycle, cell uptake of Rh-123, as well as mRNA and protein levels of MDR1 and PKC-alpha were investigated to determine the biological features of OV1228/Taxol cell line. RESULT(S): The resistance index (RI) of OV1228/Taxol cells was up to 39.44. They showed an obvious cross-resistance to DDP and 5-FU. Compared with OV1228 cells, OV1228/Taxol resistant cells were significantly heteromorphosis, and the population doubling time was significantly longer (P = 0.0335). The results of uptake of Rh-123 further proved that OV1228/Taxol cells had a significant resistance to Rh-123 (P = 0.0054). PT-PCR and Western bolt studies showed that the levels of PKC-alpha and MDR1 mRNA and protein expression in the OV1228/Taxol cells were higher than those in the sensitive cells. CONCLUSION(S): OV1228/Taxol cell line shows typical multidrug resistance phenotypes and might serve as an ideal model for exploring the new route of reversing multidrug resistance.

N2  -  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in women. Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of both early-stage and advanced breast cancer. In the past decade, novel formulations of these cytotoxic agents have been developed to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity. nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free, albumin-bound 130-nm particle form of paclitaxel (Abraxane, Abraxis Bioscience, CA, USA), which was developed to avoid toxicities associated with the Cremophor vehicle used in solvent-based paclitaxel. In a Phase III study, nab-paclitaxel demonstrated higher response rates, a better safety profile compared with conventional paclitaxel, and improved survival in patients receiving it as second-line therapy. Based on this pivotal trial, nab-paclitaxel is now approved in the USA for treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant therapy where prior therapy included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated. Recently, several Phase II studies have suggested a role for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination with other agents for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Studies are ongoing to explore the use of nab-paclitaxel in other solid tumors such as non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and malignant melanoma. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

N2  -  Glycosylation, one of the most common post translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, is often associated with carcinogenesis and tumor malignancy. Ovarian cancer is the sixth cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Currently, it is treated by debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy based on paclitaxel, alone or in combination with other drugs. However, chemoresistance represents a major obstacle to positive clinical outcome. We used two approaches, Multiplexed Proteomics (MP) technology and Multilectin Affinity Chromatography (MAC) to characterize the glycoproteome of the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 and its paclitaxel resistant counterpart A2780TC1. Furthermore proteins were separated by traditional 2DE or DIGE and identified by MS (MALDI TOF or LC MS/MS). Seventy glycoproteins were successfully identified in ovarian cancer cells and 10 were found to be differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cell lines. We focused on four glycoproteins (tumor rejection antigen (gp96) 1, triose phosphate isomerase, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 precursor and ER-associated DNAJ) which were remarkably upregulated in A2780TC1 compared to A2780 cell line and which may represent biomarkers for paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Purpose: Poly-(gamma-l-glutamylglutamine)-paclitaxel (PGG-PTX) is a novel polymer-based formulation of paclitaxel (PTX) in which the PTX is linked to the polymer via ester bonds. PGG-PTX is of interest because it spontaneously forms very small nanoparticles in plasma. In mouse models, PGG-PTX increased tumor exposure to PTX by 7.7-fold relative to that produced by PTX formulated in Cremophor. In this study, the efficacy of PGG-PTX was compared to that of Abraxane, an established nanoparticular formulation of PTX, in three different tumor models. Method(s): Efficacy was quantified by delay in tumor growth of NCI H460 human lung cancer, 2008 human ovarian cancer and B16 melanoma xenografts growing in athymic mice following administration of equitoxic doses of PGG-PTX and Abraxane administered on either a single dose or every 7 day schedule. Toxicity was assessed by change in total body weight. Result(s): The efficacy and toxicity of PGG-PTX was shown to increase with dose in the H460 model. PGG-PTX was ~1.5-fold less potent than Abraxane. PGG-PTX produced statistically significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth than Abraxane in all three tumor models when mice were given single equitoxic doses of drug. When given every 7 days for 3 doses, PGG-PTX produced greater inhibition of tumor growth while generating much less weight loss in mice bearing H460 tumors. Conclusion(s): PGG-PTX has activity that is superior to that of Abraxane in multiple tumor models. PGG-PTX has the potential to out-perform Abraxane in enhancing the delivery of PTX tumors while at the same time further reducing the toxicity of both single dose and weekly treatment regimens.

N2  -  Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as co-medication in the therapy of solid malignant tumors to relieve some of the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, recent studies have shown that GCs could render cancer cells more resistant to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis, but the mechanism is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that the treatment of human ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and SKOV3 with synthetic GCs dexamethasone (Dex) significantly increased their adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) and their resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. Dex also increased the protein levels of adhesion molecules integrins beta1, alpha4, and alpha5 in HO-8910 cells. The neutralizing antibody against integrin beta1 prevented Dex-induced adhesion and significantly abrogated the protective effect of Dex toward cytotoxic agents. We further found that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) alone not only increased cell adhesion and cell survival of HO-8910 cells in the presence of cisplatin, but also had synergistic pro-adhesion and pro-survival effects with Dex. Moreover, TGF-beta1-neutralizing antibody that could block TGF-beta1-induced cell adhesion and apoptosis resistance markedly abrogated the synergistic pro-adhesion and pro-survival effects of Dex and TGF-beta1. Finally, we further demonstrated that Dex could up-regulate the expression of TGF-beta receptor type II and enhance the responsiveness of cells to TGF-beta1. In conclusion, our results indicate that increased adhesion to ECM through the enhancement of integrin beta1 signaling and TGF-beta1 signaling plays an important role in chemoresistance induced by GCs in ovarian cancer cells. © 2010 Society for Endocrinology.

N2  -  Purpose: This study was undertaken to examine the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway in the response of ovarian cancer cells to Taxol and to evaluate the significance of this pathway in human epithelial ovarian tumors. Experimental Design: The effect of Taxol treatment on AKT activation in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells was evaluated using antibodies specific for phospho-AKT. To study the drug-resistant phenotype, we developed a Taxol-resistant cell line, HEY-T30, derived from HEY ovarian carcinoma cells. IGF2 expression was measured by real-time PCR. A type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, and IGF2 small interfering RNA were used to evaluate the effect of IGF pathway inhibition on proliferation and Taxol sensitivity. IGF2 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 115 epithelial ovarian tumors and analyzed in relation to clinical/pathologic factors using the chi2 or Fisher's exact tests. The influence of IGF2 expression on survival was studied with Cox regression. Result(s): Taxol-induced AKT phosphorylation required IGF1R tyrosine kinase activity and was associated with upregulation of IGF2. Resistant cells had higher IGF2 expression compared with sensitive cells, and IGF pathway inhibition restored sensitivity to Taxol. High IGF2 tumor expression correlated with advanced stage (P < 0.001) and tumor grade (P < 0.01) and reduced disease-free survival (P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): IGF2 modulates Taxol resistance, and tumor IGF2 expression is a candidate prognostic biomarker in epithelial ovarian tumors. IGF pathway inhibition sensitizes drug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells to Taxol. Such novel findings suggest that IGF2 represents a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, particularly in the setting of Taxol resistance. ©2010 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Using Fmoc-chemistry, we have synthesized a number of amphiphilic polymers, comprised of a cluster of cholic acids (4 to 10) linked by a series of lysines and attached to one end of a linear polyethylene glycol chain. Under aqueous condition, such telodendrimers can self-assemble to form highly stable nanomicelles. Hydrophobic drugs, radionuclides, and fluorochromes, as well as quantum dots, and iron nanoparticles can be readily loaded into the hydrophobic core of these nanomicelles. The size of the final nanocarriers (15-150 nm diameter) and their drug loading capacity are tunable depending on the size of the PEG chain and the number and arrangement of cholic acid molecules in the dendrimer. We have compared the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity profile of our paclitaxel- loaded nanomicelles with Taxol and Abraxane in nude mice bearing ovarian cancer xenograft, and determined that the nanomicelles had superior anti-tumor effects and toxicity profile. When decorated with cancer targeting ligands identified from the one-bead-one-compound combinatorial library methods the drug-loaded nanoparticles were rapidly taken up by the target tumor cells causing cell death. In vivo near infra-red optical imaging studies with hydrophobic fluorescent dye demonstrated that xenograft uptake of the nanomicelles was greatly enhanced by the cancer targeting peptide. This novel nanoplatform shows great promise in future cancer therapy and imaging. In addition, it could also be exploited as a highly efficient intracellular delivery tool for basic research.

N2  -  Background: The tumor vasculature is an established target for anticancer therapies. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) compromise established tumor vasculature and have the potential to destroy tumor masses as well as preventing progression. ABI-011, a novel thiocolchicine dimer, is a potent VDA with antitubulin and topoisomerase 1 inhibitor properties. ABI-011 displayed significant anti-tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of human breast, colon, prostate, and ovarian carcinoma. In this study, the importance of dose, schedule, and sequence for the combination of ABI-011 and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane) or bevacizumab (Avastin) was evaluated in mice bearing HT29 (colon) xenografts. Material(s) and Method(s): Potential antagonistic activity of ABI-011 against paclitaxel and docetaxel in vitro was demonstrated in vitro using MX-1 tumor cells. Subcutaneous human colon (HT29) tumors were grown in athymic nude mice and treated intravenously (IV) with sub-optimal dose of ABI-011 alone (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, q4dx3) and in combination with nab-paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, q4dx3) and/or bevacizumab (8 mg/kg, 2xwkly). The effect of dose, schedule, and sequence of combination regimen on therapeutic efficacy was tested. ABI-011 was administered 24 h before, concurrent with, or 24 h after nab-paclitaxel or bevacizumab treatment. Result(s): Antagonistic interaction was observed between paclitaxel, docetaxel and ABI-011 in vitro. There was strong synergy between Avastin and ABI-011, with the combination exhibiting significantly better antitumor activity than either Avastin (P = 0.028) or ABI-011 alone (P = 0.003). When combined with ABI-011 + Avastin, nab-paclitaxel exhibited best additive improvement when administered concurrent with ABI-011 (Concurrent vs 24hr prior to nab-paclitaxel: P = 0.06; Concurrent vs 24 hr post nab-paclitaxel: P = 0.01). The triple combination was superior to the ABI-011 + nab-paclitaxel combination (P < 0.001) and the ABI-011 + Avastin combination (P = 0.002). Conclusion(s): ABI-011 alone and in combination with nab-paclitaxel demonstrated significant TGI in xenograft models. Possible negative interactions between the two drugs can be avoided by careful scheduling, sequencing and timing of drug administrations. The combination data suggest that effective combination of Avastin, Abraxane, and ABI-011 is feasible. The double or triple drug combination therapy would be expected to be more effective than monotherapy.

N2  -  Purpose: Systemic chemotherapy fails to access much of the tumor burden in patients with advanced cancer, significantly limiting its efficacy. In preclinical studies, brief high doses of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family can prime tumor vasculature for optimal chemotherapeutic delivery and efficacy. This study investigates the clinical relevance of this approach. Experimental Design: A phase I clinical study of escalating doses of the HER TKI lapatinib given as a 2-day pulse before a weekly infusion of nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2) was conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated. Treatment was associated with grade 1 to 2 toxicities including diarrhea, nausea, rash, neutropenia, neuropathy, fatigue, alopecia, and anemia. The two dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 vomiting and grade 4 neutropenia, and the maximum tolerated dose of lapatinib was defined as 5250 mg/day in divided doses. Lapatinib concentrations increased with increasing dose. Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in a subset of patients confirmed a decrease in tumor vascular permeability immediately following a lapatinib pulse. Sixty-five percent of evaluable patients experienced a partial or stable response on this therapy, 72% of whom were previously taxane-refractory. Conclusion(s): A 2-day pulse of high-dose lapatinib given before weekly nab-paclitaxel is a feasible and tolerable clinical regimen, suitable for testing this novel vascular-priming chemosensitization hypothesis developed in preclinical models. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Albumin is a versatile drug carrier in anti-cancer drug delivery system and it also has an actively targeting capacity to tumors. Recently, nanoparticle albumin-bound (nabTM) paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) has been approved in 2006 for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed in the combination chemotherapy, and so the nab-technology has attracted much interest in the anti-cancer drug delivery system. The details about the preparation, characterization and evaluation of nab-paclitaxel (ABI-007) are discussed. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the clinical trials of ABI-007 are also reviewed. Furthermore, the recent applications of nab-technology in the anti-cancer drug delivery systems are summarized by virtue of the patents pertaining to nab-technology. To sum up, nab-technology has a great potential of being applied extensively in the field of anti-cancer agents delivery in the future in order to acquire the good safety and better therapeutical effect. © 2009 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of a variety of cancers. However, it is associated with serious side effects caused by PTX itself and the Cremophor EL emulsifier. In the present study, we report the development of a well-defined amphiphilic linear-dendritic copolymer (named as telodendrimer) composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), cholic acid (CA, a facial amphiphilic molecule) and lysine, which can form drug-loaded core/shell micelles when mixed with hydrophobic drug, such as PTX, under aqueous condition. We have used PEG5k-CA8, a representive telodendrimer, to prepare paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (PTX-PEG5k-CA8 NPs) with high loading capacity (7.3 mg PTX/mL) and a size of 20-60 nm. This novel nanoformulation of PTX was found to exhibit similar in vitro cytotoxic activity against ovarian cancer cells as the free drug (Taxol) or paclitaxel/human serum albumin nanoaggregate (Abraxane). The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of PTX-PEG5k-CA8 NPs after single dose and five consecutive daily doses in mice were approximately 75 and 45 mg PTX/kg, respectively, which were 2.5-fold higher than those of Taxol. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic intraperitoneal murine models of ovarian cancer, PTX-PEG5k-CA8 NPs achieved superior toxicity profiles and anti-tumor effects compared to Taxol and Abraxane at equivalent PTX doses, which were attributed to their preferential tumor accumulation, and deep penetration into tumor tissue, as confirmed by near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Breast cancer is the field of medicine with the greatest presence of nanotechnological therapeutic agents in the clinic. A pegylated form of liposomally encapsulated doxorubicin is routinely used for treatment against metastatic cancer, and albumin nanoparticulate chaperones of paclitaxel were approved for locally recurrent and metastatic disease in 2005. These drugs have yielded substantial clinical benefit, and are steadily gathering greater beneficial impact. Clinical trials currently employing these drugs in combination with chemo and biological therapeutics exceed 150 worldwide. Despite these advancements, breast cancer morbidity and mortality is unacceptably high. Nanotechnology offers potential solutions to the historical challenge that has rendered breast cancer so difficult to contain and eradicate: the extreme biological diversity of the disease presentation in the patient population and in the evolutionary changes of any individual disease, the multiple pathways that drive disease progression, the onset of 'resistance' to established therapeutic cocktails, and the gravity of the side effects to treatment, which result from generally very poor distribution of the injected therapeutic agents in the body. A fundamental requirement for success in the development of new therapeutic strategies is that breast cancer specialists-in the clinic, the pharmaceutical and the basic biological laboratory-and nanotechnologists-engineers, physicists, chemists and mathematicians-optimize their ability to work in close collaboration. This further requires a mutual openness across cultural and language barriers, academic reward systems, and many other 'environmental' divides. This paper is respectfully submitted to the community to help foster the mutual interactions of the breast cancer world with micro- and nano-technology, and in particular to encourage the latter community to direct ever increasing attention to breast cancer, where an extraordinary beneficial impact may result. The paper initiates with an introductory overview of breast cancer, its current treatment modalities, and the current role of nanotechnology in the clinic. Our perspectives are then presented on what the greatest opportunities for nanotechnology are; this follows from an analysis of the role of biological barriers that adversely determine the biological distribution of intravascularly injected therapeutic agents. Different generations of nanotechnology tools for drug delivery are reviewed, and our current strategy for addressing the sequential bio-barriers is also presented, and is accompanied by an encouragement to the community to develop even more effective ones. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

N2  -  Paclitaxel has been widely used as an anti-mitotic agent in chemotherapy for a variety of cancers and adds substantial efficacy as the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen for ovarian cancers. However, the frequent occurrence of paclitaxel resistance limits its function in long-term management. Despite abundant clinical and cellular demonstration of paclitaxel resistant tumors, the molecular mechanisms leading to paclitaxel resistance are poorly understood. Using genomic approaches, we have previously identified an association between a BTB/POZ gene, NAC1, and paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. The experiments presented here have applied multiple quantitative proteomic methods to identify protein changes associated with paclitaxel resistance and NAC1 function. The SKOV-3 ovarian serous carcinoma cell line, which has inducible expression of dominant-negative NAC1, was used to determine the paclitaxel treatment associated changes in the presence and absence of functional NAC1. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using iTRAQ labeling and MS. Two label-free quantitative proteomic methods: LC-MS and spectral count were used to increase confidence of proteomic quantification. Candidate proteins related to paclitaxel and NAC1 function were identified in this study. Gene ontology analysis of the protein changes identified upon paclitaxel resistance revealed that cell component enrichment related to mitochondria. Moreover, tubulin and mitochondrial proteins were the major cellular components with changes associated with paclitaxel treatment. This suggests that mitochondria may play a role in paclitaxel resistance. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

N2  -  Paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer, is an effective agent for treating cancer of the breast, ovary, head and neck, and lung. Because paclitaxel is insoluble in water, it is formulated with the micelle-forming Cremophor EL. Neurologic toxicity is well described with both the drug and this carrier, with most toxicities manifesting as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and myopathy. Toxic effects on the central nervous system, such as seizures or encephalopathy, have been rarely reported; however, the seizures reported were closely related to the time of infusion. We describe a 41-year-old woman with no history of seizures who was treated with paclitaxel for breast cancer. Four days after the drug was infused, she developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that could not be attributed to other causes. The patient was treated with phenytoin and was able to complete her adjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel without further events. Her condition was neurologically stable without phenytoin for the next 6 months. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible association (score of 3) between the delayed seizure and paclitaxel or its solvent, Cremophor EL. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for seizure activity in patients who receive paclitaxel formulated with Cremophor EL.

N2  -  Nanotechnology is an emerging branch of science for designing tools and devices of size 1 to 100 nm with unique function at the cellular, atomic and molecular levels. The concept of using nanotechnology in medical research and clinical practice is known as nanomedicine. Nanoparticles possess some novel properties not seen with the macro molecules and they can be manipulated by attaching therapeutic components to help in diagnosis and treatment. They can also be used to probe cellular movements and molecular changes associated with pathological states. Nanodevices like carbon nanotubes to locate and deliver anticancer drugs at the specific tumour site are under research. Nanotechnology promises construction of artificial cells, enzymes and genes. This will help in the replacement therapy of many disorders which are due to deficiency of enzymes, mutation of genes or any repair in the synthesis of proteins. Currently nanodevices like respirocytes, microbivores and probes encapsulated by biologically localized embedding have a greater application in treatment of anaemia and infections. Thus in the present scenario, nanotechnology is spreading its wings to address the key problems in the field of medicine. Hence this review discusses in detail the applications of nanotechnology in medicine with more emphasis on drug delivery and therapy. © 2009 Societe Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.

N2  -  Mesothelin, a secreted protein, is overexpressed in some cancers, but its exact function remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible function of mesothelin. Real-time PCR, RT (reverse transcription)-PCR, cytotoxicity assays, proliferative assays, apoptotic assays by Hoechst staining, detection of active caspases 3 and 7 by flow cytometric analysis, and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed. Cancer tissues in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer patients expressed higher levels of mesothelin as assessed using real-time PCR than paclitaxel-sensitive ovarian cancer patients (the mean crossing point value change of mesothelin was 26.9+/-0.4 in the resistant group and 34.3+/-0.7 for the sensitive group; P<0.001). Mesothelin also protected cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. The protein expression of Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, was significantly increased regardless of whether cells were treated with exogenous mesothelin or were mesothelin-transfectants. Furthermore, mesothelin-treated cells revealed rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 for enhancing MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity. The anti-apoptotic ability was suppressed and the expression of Bcl-2 family in response to mesothelin was altered by inhibiting PI3K activity, but not by inhibiting MAPK activity. Thus mesothelin can inhibit paclitaxel-induced cell death mainly by involving PI3K signalling in the regulation of Bcl-2 family expression. Mesothelin is a potential target in reducing resistance to cytotoxic drugs. © The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Biochemical Society.

N2  -  Background: Taxanes are presently widely employed for the medical treatment of cancer. However, despite the huge clinical success, these agents exhibit clinical problems related to poor drug solubility, toxicity and, in particular, drug resistance. Objective(s): To identify the critical points related to the process of development of novel taxanes. Method(s): Publicly available data on the paclitaxel and docetaxel analogues, which have entered a clinical development phase in the last 2 years have been taken into consideration. The development involved novel formulations of paclitaxel and novel chemical entities. For each agent in each category the development phase is analysed and a synthetic comment for each category is included. Results/conclusions: Despite all the efforts, until now clinical success with the new development of taxanes has been limited. Moreover, the expected clinical introduction of epothilones could further restrict the space for development of novel taxanes. Despite these facts, some interesting concepts emerged during the process of development and could lead to successful drugs in the forthcoming years. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  -  Purpose: 130-nm albumin - bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a novel solvent-free albumin-bound paclitaxel, designed to avoid solvent-related toxicity. Nab-paclitaxel has been successfully introduced into the clinic but its radiation-enhancing potential has not yet been evaluated. We conducted a preclinical evaluation of the radiation-modulating effects of nab-paclitaxel in tumor and normal tissues. Experimental Design: Mice bearing syngeneic ovarian or mammary carcinomas were treated with nab-paclitaxel, radiation, or combination of both. Nab-paclitaxel was administered at 90 mg/kg, 1.5 times the maximum tolerated dose for solvent-based paclitaxel. End points were antitumor efficacy (growth delay, radiocurability, and cellular effects) and normal tissue toxicity (gut and skin). Result(s): Nab-paclitaxel showed single-agent antitumor efficacy against both tumor types and acted as a radiosensitizer. Combined with radiation, nab-paclitaxel produced supra-additive effects when given before radiation. Nab-paclitaxel significantly increased radiocurability by reducing the dose yielding 50% tumor cure (TCD50) from 54.3 to 35.2 Gy. Tumor histology following nab-paclitaxel treatment was characterized by pronounced necrotic and apoptotic cell death and mitotic arrest. Nab-paclitaxel did not increase normal tissue radioresponse. Conclusion(s): Nab-paclitaxel exhibited strong antitumor efficacy against both tumors as a single agent and it improved radiotherapy in a supra-additive manner. These improved effects were achieved without increased normal tissue toxicity to either rapidly or slowly proliferating normal tissues although the drug dose was 1.5 times higher than the maximum tolerated dose of solvent-based paclitaxel. These preclinical findings show that combining nab-paclitaxelwith radiotherapy would improve the outcome of taxane-based chemoradiotherapy. This novel taxane is thus a good candidate for testing in clinical chemoradiotherapy trials. © 2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Purpose: Abraxane (ABi-007) is a 130-nm albumin-bound (nab) particle formulation of paclitaxel, devoid of any additional excipients. We hypothesized that this change in formulation alters the systemic disposition of paclitaxel compared with conventional solvent-based formulations (sb-paclitaxel;Taxol), and leads to improved tolerability of the drug. Patients and Methods: Patients with malignant solid tumors were randomized to receive the recommended single-agent dose of nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2 as a 30-minute infusion) or sb-paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion). After cycle 1, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out for the first cycle of sb-paclitaxel and the first two cycles of nab-paclitaxel. Result(s): Seventeen patients were treated, with 14 receiving at least one cycle each of nabpaclitaxel and sb-paclitaxel. No change in nab -paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was found between the first and second cycles (P = 0.95), suggesting limited intrasubject variability. Total drug exposure was comparable between the two formulations (P - 0.55) despite the dose difference. However, exposure to unbound paclitaxel was significantly higher after nab-paclitaxel administration, due to the increased free fraction (0.063 +/- 0.021 versus 0.024 +/- 0.009; P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): This study shows that paclitaxel disposition is subject to considerable variability depending on the formulation used. Because systemic exposure to unbound paclitaxel is likely a driving force behind tumoral uptake, these findings explain, at least in part, previous observations that the administration of nab -paclitaxel is associated with augmented antitumor efficacy compared with solvent-based paclitaxel. © 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  The application of taxane chemotherapy to the treatment of early-stage and advanced breast cancer has resulted in significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival. As a consequence of these improvements in disease outcome, oncologists must face the new challenge of developing additional therapies that are effective against taxane-resistant disease and are associated with a favorable toxicity profile. This article discusses some of the chemotherapeutic options available for the treatment of patients with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer. Newer formulations of traditional microtubule-stabilizing agents, such as albumin-bound paclitaxel, which uses a more favorable vehicle for administration compared with conventional paclitaxel, have demonstrated efficacy in this setting. Several novel microtubule-targeting agents have been shown to be less susceptible to traditional mechanisms of taxane resistance, such as the multidrug resistance phenotype associated with increased activity of the P-glycoprotein drug efflux system and the development of structural changes in tubulin. Examples of these therapies include the vinca alkaloids, such as vinorelbine and vinflunine; epothilones; and eribulin. Traditional antimetabolites, such as gemcitabine and capecitabine, used as monotherapy or combination chemotherapy have also shown efficacy in the treatment of patients with taxane-resistant breast cancer. A greater understanding of the mechanism of drug resistance, as it pertains to taxanes, will enable further development and the effective application of chemotherapeutic agents that will circumvent drug resistance and result in improvement in breast cancer control.

N2  -  Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) has demonstrated significant activity in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) following the failure of prior combination chemotherapy. Moreover, toxicity was reduced compared with that of standard paclitaxel due to the absence of the polyethylated castor oil solvent required for paclitaxel. These results, together with data from preclinical models, have led to evaluation of nab-paclitaxel in other paclitaxel-sensitive tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ovarian cancer. In a phase II trial in metastatic melanoma, nab-paclitaxel was active in both chemotherapy-naive and previously treated patients, with results comparable with those of other therapy. Single-agent nab-paclitaxel therapy resulted in moderate activity in advanced NSCLC; greater activity with acceptable toxicity was seen using combinations of nab-paclitaxel with carboplatin or other agents. Preliminary data also suggest that this agent is active in platinum-sensitive, advanced, recurrent ovarian cancer. These results indicate that, in addition to MBC, nab-paclitaxel has encouraging antitumor activity in multiple paclitaxel-sensitive solid tumors, with less toxicity than that of standard pacliraxel-based therapy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  The solvents used in conventional taxane formulations are associated with increased toxicity, prolonged infusion times, need for steroid premedication, and a potential adverse effect on treatment efficacy. Enhanced-delivery taxanes (EDTs) include the first-generation agent nab-paclitaxel (ABI-007, Abraxane), a nanoparticle-sized, albumin-bound paclitaxel formulation that is approved for use in metastatic breast cancer. In a phase III trial in this setting, nab-paclitaxel given on an every-3-week schedule was shown to result in improved efficacy and reduced neutropenia compared with conventional paclitaxel and was associated with no severe hypersensitivity reactions despite the absence of routine steroid premedication. A recent randomized phase II trial has yielded promising findings with weekly nab-paclitaxel compared with docetaxel in the first-line treatment of metastatic disease. Second-generation EDTs, which seek both to exploit the enhanced permeability and retention in tumors and avoid drug micelle trapping, include paclitaxel poliglumex and the injectable emulsion formulation Tocosol paclitaxel. These agents have shown activity in early phase trials. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Solvent-based delivery vehicles for chemotherapy agents have been instrumental in providing a means for hydrophobic agents to be administered intravenously. These solvents, however, have been associated with serious and dose-limiting toxicities. Solvent-based formulations of taxanes, a highly active class of cytotoxic agents, are associated with hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, and neuropathy. Nanoparticle technology utilizing the human protein albumin exploits natural pathways to selectively deliver larger amounts of drug to tumors while avoiding some of the toxicities of solvent-based formulations. 130 nM albumin-bound (nabTM) paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) was recently approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed combination therapy. In a randomized, phase III study in metastatic breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel was found to have improved efficacy and safety compared with conventional, solvent-based paclitaxel. Preliminary data also suggest roles for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer as well as in other solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma. The nab technology promises to have broad utility in cancer therapy, and clinical trials are underway using nab formulations of other water-insoluble anticancer agents such as docetaxel and rapamycin. © 2008.

N2  -  A significant advance in cancer treatment was achieved in the mid-1990s with the introduction of solvent-based taxanes. However, first-generation taxanes required synthetic solvents to promote parenteral administration, occasionally caused serious toxicities, and compromised treatment efficacy. This led to the development of second-generation taxanes, including a solvent-free albumin-bound form of paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel). Numerous studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents for the treatment of breast cancer. Results from several recent trials also suggest a role for nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This article reviews the clinical efficacy and emerging role for novel taxanes in the treatment of breast and other solid tumors, and provides an overview of key issues for consideration in the clinical application of novel taxanes in cancer treatment regimens in order to achieve optimal antitumor efficacy while minimizing adverse events. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  -  Nanoparticles (size in nanometer range) provide a new mode of cancer drug delivery functioning as a carrier for entry through fenestrations in tumor vasculature allowing direct cell access. These particles allow exquisite modification for binding to cancer cell membranes, the microenvironment, or to cytoplasmic or nuclear receptor sites. This results in delivery of high drug concentrations to the targeted cancer cell, with reduced toxicity of normal tissue. Several such engineered drugs are in clinical practice, including liposomal doxorubicin and albumin conjugate paclitaxel. The carrier mediated paclitaxel has already shown significant efficacy in taxane resistant cancers, an approach highly relevant in prostate cancer, where taxanes are the treatment of choice. Other modifications including transferrin receptor and folate receptor targeted drug delivery molecules are in study. This new technology provides many exciting therapeutic approaches for targeted high concentration drug delivery to cancer cells with reduced injury of normal cells. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Purpose: Albumin-bound paclitaxel, ABI-007 (Abraxane), has a different toxicity profile than solvent-based paclitaxel, including a lower rate of severe neutropenia. The combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin may have significant activity in a variety of tumor types including non-small and small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007, on three different schedules in combination with carboplatin. Method(s): Forty-one patients with solid tumors were enrolled, and received ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin AUC of 6 on day 1. Group A received ABI-007 at doses ranging from 220 to 340 mg/m2 on day 1 every 21 days; group B received ABI-007 at 100 or 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; and group C received ABI-007 125 or 150 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed after the first cycle. Doses were escalated in cohorts of three to six patients. Fifteen patients participated in a pharmacokinetic study investigating the effects of the sequence of infusion. ABI-007 was infused first followed by carboplatin in cycle 1, and vice versa in cycle 2. Result(s): The MTD of ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin was 300, 100, and 125 mg/m2 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Myelosuppression was the primary dose limiting toxicity. No unexpected or new toxicities were reported. Sequence of infusion did not affect either the pharmacokinetics of ABI-007 or the degree of neutropenia. Responses were seen in melanoma, lung, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, breast cancer, and cancer of unknown primary. Conclusion(s): The recommended dose for phase II studies of ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin (AUC of 6) is 300, 100, 125 mg/m2 for the schedules A, B, and C, respectively. The combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin is well tolerated and active in this heavily pretreated patient population. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

N2  -  It has been proposed that chemotherapy enhances tumor antigen (TA)-specific immunity. The molecular form of TA from ovarian tumor that activates cellular immunity is unknown. We report here identification of a novel molecular form of immunogenic TA for CD8+ cells named self-immune stimulatory multimolecular complexes (ISMMC). ISMMC consist of a molecular complex of polyosome/ribosome-bound ubiquitinated nascent HER-2 polypeptides. This complex is chaperoned by heat shock protein Gp96, which mediates ISMMC uptake by antigen-presenting cells through the scavenger receptor CD91. RNAs in ISMMC stimulate immature dendritic cells to secrete interleukin 12 and induce IFN-gamma in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ISMMC dissociate, retrotranslocate from the lysosome to cytoplasm, and are processed to peptides by the proteasome. At subpharmacologic doses, Taxol increased the amount of ISMMC by three to four times and modified their composition by inducing the attachment of cochaperones of HSP70, such as the mitoticphase phosphoprotein 11J. On a total protein basis, Taxol induced ISMMC, expanded more CD8 + cells, activated more CD56+ NKG2D+ cells to produce IFN-gamma, and were more potent inducers of high T-cell receptor density Perforin+ cells than native ISMMC and peptide E75. Elucidation of the composition of ISMMC and identification of adducts formed by Taxol should be important for developing molecular cancer vaccines. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a sensory neuropathy that affects thousands of cancer patients each year as paclitaxel is commonly used to treat breast, non-small cell lung and ovarian cancer. To begin to define the type and location of sensory neurons most impacted by paclitaxel, we examined rat trigeminal ganglion, thoracic and lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 10 days following intravenous infusion of clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel. To define the population of cells injured by paclitaxel, we examined the expression of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), a marker of cell injury; to define the hypertrophy of satellite cells, we quantified the expression of the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); and to define the activation of macrophages, we examined the expression of the lysosomal protein CD68. Intravenous infusion of paclitaxel induced a significant increase of ATF3 in mainly but not exclusively large and medium sensory neurons in all sensory ganglia. An increase in both GFAP immunofluorescence in satellite cells and the number of activated macrophages occurred in lumbar > thoracic > trigeminal ganglia of paclitaxel-treated rats. This differential expression of cellular markers suggests that the largest sensory cell bodies with the longest axons are the most at risk of being injured by paclitaxel (size and length dependent pathology). These results provide a pathological basis for the anatomical distribution of paclitaxel-induced symptoms in patients receiving therapeutic regimens of paclitaxel. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  -  PURPOSE: ABI-007 is a novel solvent-free, albumin-bound, 130-nm particle formulation of paclitaxel designed to avoid solvent-related toxicities and to deliver paclitaxel to tumors via molecular pathways involving an endothelial cell-surface albumin receptor (gp60) and an albumin-binding protein expressed by tumor cells and secreted into the tumor interstitium (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine). This study determined the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007 monotherapy administered weekly (three weekly doses, repeated every 4 weeks) and assessed the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered as ABI-007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies received ABI-007 without premedication at dose levels from 80 to 200 mg/m(2) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest (one cycle). RESULT(S): Thirty-nine patients were treated with an average of five cycles of ABI-007; 33% of patients received > or = six cycles of treatment. MTDs for heavily and lightly pretreated patients were 100 and 150 mg/m(2), respectively; and the dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Maximum paclitaxel concentration and area under the curve increased linearly with dose. Dose-dependent changes in plasma clearance did not occur. Partial responses were observed in five patients with breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, all of whom had previously been treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil in the formulation. CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrated that weekly ABI-007 can be administered at doses exceeding those typically used for paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil. Pharmacokinetics were linear over the dose range studied. Antitumor responses occurred in patients previously treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil.

N2  -  Taxanes are standard treatment for metastatic breast cancer; however, the solvents used as vehicles in these formulations cause severe toxicities. The FDA recently approved a solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer that utilises 130-nanometer albumin-bound (nabTM) technology (Abraxane; nab-paclitaxel) to circumvent the requirement for solvents. nab-Paclitaxel utilises the natural properties of albumin to reversibly bind paclitaxel, transport it across the endothelial cell and concentrate it in areas of tumour. The proposed mechanism of drug delivery involves, in part, glycoprotein 60-mediated enclothelial cell transcytosis of paclitaxel-bound albumin and accumulation in the area of tumour by albumin binding to SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine). Clinical studies have shown that nab-paclitaxel is significantly more effective than paclitaxel formulated as Cremophor EL (CrEL, Taxol, CrEL-paclitaxel), with almost double the response rate, increased time to disease progression and increased survival in second-line patients. The absence of CrEL from the formulation is associated with decreased neutropenia and rapid improvement of peripheral neuropathy with nab-paclitaxel, compared with CrEL-paclitaxel. For these reasons, nab-paclitaxel can be administered using higher doses of paclitaxel than that achievable with CrEL-paclitaxel, with shorter infusion duration and without the requirement for corticosteroid and antihistamine premedication to reduce the risk of solvent-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Taken together, these studies have demonstrated that nab technology has increased the therapeutic index of paclitaxel compared with the conventional, solvent-based formulation. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.

N2  -  Background. Paclitaxel is one of the most active agents in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. However, paclitaxel is solubilized in cremophor, a polyoxyethylated castor oil. Cremophor is allegedly responsible for many paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). Novel agents such as abraxane are solvent free and currently being evaluated to potentially avoid certain patient side effects. Case. We present a case involving a 60-year-old ovarian cancer patient with a significant history of chemotherapy induced HSR. She underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery and began adjuvant chemotherapy in 2000 until she suffered a severe HSR to paclitaxel. In 2002, she was diagnosed with recurrent disease and underwent subsequent treatment with carboplatin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, all of which resulted in severe HSR. The patient began abraxane therapy in 2005 and has shown no signs of HSR. Conclusion. Abraxane is a solvent free taxane, which can be administered without the pre-medications routinely used to prevent HSR. Abraxane may offer paclitaxel HSR patients the benefit of continued taxane treatment. Although the clinical activity of abraxane has not been extensively investigated in ovarian carcinoma, the distinct activity of paclitaxel and good results with recurrent metastatic breast cancer patients suggest additional evaluation with this drug is important. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Two taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, are among the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents in solid tumor oncology, with efficacy against tumors of the breast, lung, head and neck, ovary, prostate, stomach and urothelium. The taxanes have been studied extensively and have been proven effective for treating early and advanced breast cancer. However, paclitaxel and docetaxel are both highly hydrophobic compounds, requiring synthetic solvents for parenteral administration. The solvents in commercially available preparations cause life-threatening toxic effects and decreased efficacy, and they are inconvenient to administer. Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nabP) is a novel, solvent-free formulation of paclitaxel. With nabP, in contrast to standard paclitaxel, life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions have not been observed, and it can be administered safely without steroid and antihistamine premedication. Furthermore, nabP exploits cellular and tumor transport mechanisms to preferentially target tumor cells. Data from phase III studies of metastatic breast cancer demonstrated higher response rates, longer time to progression and an improved toxicity profile for nabP compared with standard paclitaxel. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved nabP in late 2004 for treatment of metastatic breast cancer after failure of an anthracycline-based regimen. © 2006 Prous Science.

N2  -  Cyclin A-associated kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), participate in regulating cellular progression from G1 to S to G2, and CDK2 has also been implicated in the transition to mitosis. The antitumor properties of CDK inhibitors, alone or in combination with taxanes, are currently being examined in clinical trials. Here, we examined whether the activity of kinases associated with cyclin A (such as CDK2) is important in determining cellular sensitivity to paclitaxel, a taxane and mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapy for breast and ovarian cancer. We used adenoviral suppression or overexpression to manipulate the expression of CDK2 and cyclin A in one breast cancer and three ovarian cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to paclitaxel and assessed protein expression, kinase activity, cell cycle distribution, and sensitivity to paclitaxel. Transfection of a dominant-negative (DN)-CDK2 evoked resistance to paclitaxel by preventing cellular progression to mitosis through loss of CDK1 activity. Reexpression of wild-type CDK2 in DN-CDK2-transfected cancer cells restored CDK2 activity but not paclitaxel sensitivity. However, expression of cyclin A in DN-CDK2-transfected cells restored their sensitivity to paclitaxel. Although CDK2 activity was not directly involved in paclitaxel sensitivity, cyclin A-associated kinases did up-regulate CDK1 via phosphorylation. We conclude that cyclin A-associated kinase activity is required for these cells to enter mitosis and undergo paclitaxel-induced cell death. Combining taxane chemotherapy with any drug targeting cyclin A-associated kinases (e.g., pure CDK2 inhibitors) should be done with caution, if it all, because of the potential for enhancing taxane resistance.

N2  -  Objectives. Paclitaxel (Taxol), a potent drug of natural origin isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, is widely used in the treatment of ovarian, lung and breast cancer. At present, there is little information regarding the anti-cancer mechanism of paclitaxel against cervical carcinoma cells. We thus tried to show the anti-cancer effect of paclitaxel on cervical carcinoma cell line carrying HPV by using a proteomic analysis and to investigate the mechanism of actions. Methods. We treated paclitaxel to cervical carcinoma cells and then carried out MTT assay to observe the anti-proliferate activity. Using proteomics analysis including two-dimensional (2-DE) gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS, we tried to find the anti-proliferate activity-related proteins. Among them, paclitaxel treatment suppressed the expression of the mitotic checkpoint protein BUB3. Functional proteomic analysis by small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting was tried to illuminate a role of mitotic checkpoint protein BUB3 in cell cycle progression. Results. The cytotoxicity effects of paclitaxel were determined in HPV-16 positive CaSki, HPV-18 positive HeLa and HPV-negative C33A cervical carcinoma cell lines. Using efficient proteomics methods including 2-DE/MALDI-TOF-MS, we identified several cellular proteins that are responsive to paclitaxel treatment in HeLa cells. Paclitaxel treatment elevated mainly apoptosis-related, immune response-related and cell cycle check point-related proteins. On the other hand, paclitaxel treatment diminished growth factor/oncogene-related proteins and transcription regulation-related proteins. Paclitaxel showed anti-proliferate activity through the membrane death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptotic pathway involving activation of caspase-8 with a TRAIL-dependent fashion as well as the mitochondrial-mediated pathway involving down-regulation of bcl-2 by cytochrome c release. Furthermore, we found siRNA-induced BUB3 knock down on cell cycle progression blocked by cell cycle arrest after paclitaxel treatment. Conclusions. The proteome profiling technique provided a broad-base and effective approach for the identification of protein changes induced by paclitaxel and showed anti-proliferate activity through the membrane death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, the mitochondrial-mediated pathway. This study shows the power of proteomic profiling with functional analysis using RNAi technology for the discovery of novel molecular targets and a better understanding of the actions of paclitaxel at the molecular level in cervical carcinoma cells. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Purpose: ABI-007 is a novel solvent-free, albumin-bound, 130-nm particle formulation of paclitaxel designed to avoid solvent-related toxicities and to deliver paclitaxel to tumors via molecular pathways involving an endothelial cell-surface albumin receptor (gp60) and an albumin-binding protein expressed by tumor cells and secreted into the tumor interstitium (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine). This study determined the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007 monotherapy administered weekly (three weekly doses, repeated every 4 weeks) and assessed the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered as ABI-007. Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies received ABI-007 without premedication at dose levels from 80 to 200 mg/m 2 as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest (one cycle). Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were treated with an average of five cycles of ABI-007; 33% of patients received a six cycles of treatment. MTDs for heavily and lightly pretreated patients were 100 and 150 mg/m2, respectively; and the dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Maximum paclitaxel concentration and area under the curve increased linearly with dose. Dose-dependent changes in plasma clearance did not occur. Partial responses were observed in five patients with breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, all of whom had previously been treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil in the formulation. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that weekly ABI-007 can be administered at doses exceeding those typically used for paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil. Pharmacokinetics were linear over the dose range studied. Antitumor responses occurred in patients previously treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil. © 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

N2  -  Src tyrosine kinase has been found to be overexpressed in both mouse and human ovarian cancer cells as well as in human primary ovarian cancers. Furthermore, Src inhibition sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel and cisplatin. Interestingly, Src inhibition has also been shown to resensitize paclitaxel-resistant cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel. The current study was undertaken in an effort to determine the mechanism by which Src resensitizes drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The paclitaxel-resistant human (CaOV3TaxR) and mouse (ID8TaxR) ovarian cancer cell lines express large amounts of the multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) protein compared with the paclitaxel-sensitive parent cell lines. Src inhibition had no effect on MDR-1 protein expression. Furthermore, Src inhibition did not affect MDR-1 function as determined by rhodamine 123 and paclitaxel uptake or retention. Coinhibition of both Src and MDR-1 synergistically enhanced paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Src enhanced microtubule stabilization in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells treated with paclitaxel without affecting expression of beta-tubulin isotypes and resulted in multipolar spindle formation and apoptosis. These results show that Src inhibition restores paclitaxel sensitivity to paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells by an MDR-independent mechanism, possibly by decreasing the critical intracellular concentration at which paclitaxel induces tubulin stabilization and bundling. Src tyrosine kinase may provide a viable target for therapeutic intervention in drug-resistant ovarian cancer. ©2005 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibitory effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, sirolimus on expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha protein and growth of ovarian carcinoma in an athymic mouse xenogeneic transplant model of ovarian cancer. METHOD(S): Four groups of female nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with SKOV3 cells. After inoculation, mice were treated with saline, rapamycin alone, paclitaxel alone and sirolimus + paclitaxel. In each tumor protein expressions of HIF-1alpha, bcl-2 and apoptosis were determined by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. RESULT(S): In sirolimus and sirolimus + paclitaxel groups protein expression of HIF-1alpha was inhibited. Tumor burden in rapamycin alone, sirolimus + paclitaxel, and paclitaxel alone was reduced by 47.9% (P < 0.05), 51.0% (P < 0.05), and 31.8% (P > 0.05) respectively compared with controls. Cell apoptosis inder in sirolimus alone (36), sirolimus + paclitaxel (40), paclitaxel alone (22), increased compared with control (15), while expression of bcl-2 decreased compared with control. CONCLUSION(S): Sirolimus inhibited protein expression of HIF-1alpha, increased tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor growth.

N2  -  ABI 007 [AbraxaneTM] is an albumin-stabilised nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel designed to overcome insolubility problems encountered with paclitaxel. This then eliminates the need for toxic solvents like cremophor, which limits the dose of paclitaxel that can be administered and hence affect overall drug efficacy. Studies have shown that the albumin receptor-mediated paclitaxel-transport mechanism is analogous to the opening of a 'trapdoor' on the endothelial cell wall within blood vessels. This facilitates the passage of ABI 007 from the bloodstream via the blood vessels to the underlying turmour tissue. ABI 007 is being developed for the treatment of a variety of tumour types by American Pharmaceutical Partners. In addition to the standard infusion formulation of ABI 007, oral and pulmonary delivery formulations are also being investigated. American Pharmaceutical Partners, a subsidiary of American BioScience, secured exclusive North American marketing and manufacturing rights to ABI 007 from American BioScience in November 2001. In anticipation of product launch within the fourth quarter of 2004, the company formed Abraxis Oncology and recruited an experienced sales and marketing team. The company has also accumulated approximately $US28 million of paclitaxel inventory. As such, American Pharmaceutical Partners anticipates pre-launch expenses to cost approximately $US40 million, incurred over 2004. In addition, the company expects to make two milestone payments worth $US10 million as well as $US15 million, based upon US FDA acceptance of NDA filing in the second quarter of 2004 and subsequent US FDA approval, respectively. The milestone for US FDA approval would be capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the product. Previously, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that its rolling NDA submission for ABI 007 commenced in May 2003. In July 2003, the company announced that this was progressing on schedule and expected to have completed its entire NDA submission by the end of 2003. The company also began preparations to form a sales and marketing group in anticipation of product launch. In addition, production of commercial quantities of ABI 007 was expected to begin in the second half of 2003. The US FDA granted fast-track status to ABI 007 for this indication in January 2003. The decision for NDA filing was based on the successful completion of a phase III trial evaluating ABI 007 versus standard paclitaxel among 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer in the US. In September 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners and American BioScience jointly announced positive interim results from the trial, which shows that the primary efficacy objective had been exceeded. American BioScience completed this phase III trial in early 2003 with the results unblinded in mid-2003. The phase III study directly compared the efficacy of ABI 007 260 mg/m2 versus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2. Both agents were administered every 3 weeks. ABI 007 was administered as a 30-minute infusion without steroid pretreatment. Paclitaxel-treated patients received steroid pretreatment and the drug was administered over 3 hours. Enrolment was completed in December 2002 with 460 first- and second-line metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled. A Data Monitoring Committee concluded in October 2002 that a sample-size adjustment of the phase III trial was not required and that the study could be continued to completion. A phase II trial of ABI 007 was also underway in metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed taxane therapy. The trial was evaluating a weekly rather than 3-weekly regimen of ABI 007. Also in February 2004, American BioScience initiated a multicentre phase II trial in patients with metastatic melanoma. The trial will evaluate both chemotherapy-naive patients (at a dose of 150 mg/m2 administered weekly) and patients who have previously received chemotherapy (at a dose of 100 mg/m2 administered weekly) as treatment for metastatic disease. In May 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that ABI 007 is also being evaluated for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and cervical cancers. Phase I/II trials have also been conducted in other solid tumours, including squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and pelvis. Phase I trials have also been conducted in patients with solid tumours to evaluate the administration of ABI 007 on a weekly schedule. In September 2003, American BioScience was issued US patent No. 6 506 405, which has 89 claims covering compositions of matter and unit dosage forms. In addition, the patent covers methods of use without the requirement for pretreatment with steroid therapy or growth factor support. In July 2003, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC unanimously ruled that American BioScience is the true and rightful owner of patent No. 5 780 653. This patent covers three next-generation taxane anticancer compounds. This ruling overturned a lower court decision in a lawsuit brought in 1998 by Florida State University (FSU) and FSU Prof. Robert Holton's privately held company, Taxolog. In the lawsuit, FSU and Taxolog alleged that Prof. Holton and others at FSU were the true inventors of the compounds claimed under American BioScience's patent. © 2004 Adis Data Information BV.

N2  -  Taxol is one of the most successful drugs for the treatment of cancer because of its ability to target tubulin, block cell cycle progression at mitosis, and induce apoptosis. Despite the success of Taxol, the development of drug resistance hampers its clinical applicability. Herein we report that beta-tubulin mutant, Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibit defective mitotic response to Taxol, even at high concentrations that are sufficient to trigger apoptosis. This mitotic response-defective phenotype is independent of p53 status. We have found that survivin, the mitosis regulator and inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is deregulated in these Taxol-resistant cancer cells; Taxol fails to induce survivin levels and survivin phosphorylation in these cells, in contrast to their parental drug-sensitive counterparts. Exogenous expression of wild-type survivin is able to restore the mitotic response of the resistant cells to Taxol treatment. On the other hand, exogenous expression of dominant-negative survivin abrogates the Taxol-induced mitotic response in drug-sensitive cancer cells. We have also found that overexpression of the mitotic kinase Cdk1, which phosphorylates survivin, is unable to restore the Taxol-induced mitotic response in the resistant cells. Our results show the importance of survivin for the mitotic response in the context of Taxol resistance and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced by microtubule-targeting agents.

N2  -  Drugs that disrupt microtubule dynamics include some of the most important of cancer chemotherapies. While these drugs, which include paclitaxel (Taxol), are known to invoke the mitotic checkpoint, the factors that determine cancer cell killing remain incompletely characterized. Cells that are relatively resistant to killing by these drugs block robustly in mitosis, whereas cells sensitive to killing block only transiently in mitosis before undergoing nuclear fragmentation and death. Passage through mitosis was an absolute requirement of drug-induced death, because death was markedly reduced in cells blocked at both G1-S and G2. Cell killing was at least in part linked to the absence or inactivation of BubR1, a kinetochore-associated phosphoprotein that mediates the mitotic checkpoint. Sensitivity to paclitaxel correlated with decreased BubR1 protein expression in human cancer cell lines, including those derived from breast and ovarian cancers. Silencing of BubR1 via RNA interference inactivated the mitotic checkpoint in drug-resistant cells, and reversed resistance to paclitaxel and nocodazole. Together, these results suggest that the mitotic checkpoint is an important determinant of the efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs in killing cancer cells, potentially providing novel targets for increasing treatment efficacy.

N2  -  Objective. The role of MDR1 in clinical paclitaxel resistance remains poorly characterized. This study sought to identify the incidence and significance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression on survival, tumor response to paclitaxel and the effect of prior cytotoxic exposure on P-gp expression in patients with paired primary and recurrent ovarian cancer samples. Methods. Retrospective survival analysis. P-gp expression was evaluated immunohistochemically with antibodies c494 and c219. Results. Thirty-two patients were identified from the tumor registry. Median interval between primary and secondary surgery was 17.9 (5.7-40.9) months. Only five primary tumors (16%) demonstrated +++ staining for P-gp. First-line treatment contained paclitaxel in 17 patients (53%) and 26 patients (81%) had been exposed to P-gp exportable chemotherapy before second surgery. Only seven of the recurrent tumors (22%) were +++. Only one of seven (14% (95% CI 0-46%)) recurrent tumors with ++ or +++ staining responded to subsequent paclitaxel, while 8 of 10 (80% (CI 46-100%)) recurrent tumors with 0/+ staining responded (P = 0.025). In multivariate analysis of outcome following second surgery, response to paclitaxel (P = 0.004) and P-gp over-expression (P < 0.001) were significant predictors of survival. Conclusions. De novo strong P-gp over-expression is uncommon, appears to change little over time or with prior exposure to chemotherapy. However, P-gp over-expression is a significant prognostic factor, and at the time of disease, relapse is inversely correlated with tumor response to paclitaxel. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  A combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK/Erk) inhibitor represents a rational new approach to chemotherapy. We performed Affymetrix microarray analysis to understand the global effects of this combination in lung carcinoma. Genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis were modulated. We observed similar patterns of gene modulation in ovarian and melanoma cell lines, indicating the general applicability of these findings. Functional genomic analysis identified two genes as new targets of drug-induced tumor apoptosis. The MGSA/Gro1 gene, important in melanoma growth, was induced by paclitaxel and reduced by MEK inhibition. Blockage of paclitaxel-induced melanoma growth stimulatory activity significantly reduced melanoma growth. Additionally, the expression of topoisomerase IIIbeta, which exhibited a clear pattern of gene reduction by a combination of the two drugs, was significantly increased (5.7-fold) in primary lung cancers but not adjacent tissues. These findings provide potential new biomarkers and gene targets for the development of improved cancer treatment.

N2  -  Taxanes act by inhibiting microtubule dynamics; in this study, we have investigated mitochondria as an additional target of taxanes. We incubated isolated mitochondria in the presence of taxanes with or without stimulation of the mitochondrial respiratory state. Results showed that they rapidly induced the loss of Apsim after stimulation of the respiratory state. To evaluate the binding of [14C]paclitaxel to isolated mitochondria, mitochondrial proteins were precipitated yielding 18.6 +/- 2.1 cpm/mug of protein. After stimulation of the respiratory state, binding of [14C]paclitaxel increased up to 163.2 +/- 46.7 cpm/mug of protein. CPM values after Bcl-2 immunoprecipitation was 62.8-fold higher than those of the control antibody, thereby indicating the involvement of Bcl-2 in paclitaxel binding. Then, we established a panel of A2780 cell lines resistant to increasing doses of paclitaxel alone or to high doses of paclitaxel/cyclosporin A (A2780 TC cells). In both cases, Bcl-2 expression was consistently down-regulated, whereas levels of other members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax and Bcl-x, did not change in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines. When A2780TC cells were stably transfected with a Bcl-2 construct, paclitaxel sensitivity was partially restored, thereby supporting a direct role of Bcl-2 down-regulation in the maintenance of drug-resistance. Finally, we examined Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry in a small subset of ovarian cancer paclitaxel-resistant patients and we noticed that the protein is down-regulated in this clinical setting with respect to the expression levels found in drug-sensitive tumors. These findings demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an additional intracellular target of taxanes and that its down-regulation is involved in taxane resistance.

N2  -  ABI 007 is an albumin-stabilised nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel designed to overcome insolubility problems encountered with paclitaxel. This then eliminates the need for toxic solvents like cremophor, which limits the dose of paclitaxel that can be administered and hence effect overall drug efficacy. ABI 007 is being developed for the treatment of a variety of tumour types by American Pharmaceutical Partners. In addition to the standard infusion formulation of ABI 007, oral and pulmonary delivery formulations are also being investigated. American Pharmaceutical Partners, a subsidiary of American BioScience, secured exclusive North American marketing and manufacturing rights to ABI 007 from American BioScience in November 2001. American BioScience completed a phase III study in the US in metastatic breast cancer patients in early 2003. An indication for which ABI 007 was granted fast track status in January 2003.[1] The phase III study directly compared the efficacy of ABI 007 260 mg/m2 with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2. Both agents were administered every 3 weeks. ABI 007 was administered as a 30-minute infusion without steroid pretreatment. Paclitaxel-treated patients received steroid pretreatment and the drug was administered over 3 hours. In October 2002, a Data Monitoring Committee concluded that a sample size adjustment of the phase III trial would not be required and that the study can be continued to completion. Enrolment was completed in December 2002 with 460 first- and second-line metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled. The results were expected to be unblinded in mid-2003. A phase II trial of ABI 007 is also underway in metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed taxane therapy. The trial is evaluating a weekly rather than 3-weekly regimen of ABI 007. Earlier, in May 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that ABI 007 is also being evaluated for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and cervical cancers. However, the phase of development for these indications remains unclear.

N2  -  The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, which functions as a tumor suppressor gene. We present several lines of evidence for the mechanism of BRCA1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by using specific inhibitors of the proteasome in human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The levels of BRCA1 protein were up-regulated by proteasome inhibitors, such as MG-132 and ALLnL, suggesting rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The enhanced loss of BRCA1 protein by taxol, okadaic acid or nocodazole treatment was prevented by the proteasome inhibitors, while inhibition of other proteases was ineffective. Accumulation and proteasomal degradation of BRCA1 protein appear to be restricted entirely to the nucleus. We also detected that high molecular weight BRCA1 protein species appeared after proteasome inhibitor treatments, which indicated that ubiquitinated species were present. Moreover the half-life of BRCA1 protein was significantly increased in response to inhibition of proteasome activity. Our present data demonstrate that BRCA1 protein may be degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated pathway.

N2  -  Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the key drugs used to treat patients with ovarian cancer, although resistance to DDP can occur. Paclitaxel and SN-38 (an active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11)) are two drugs that are effective in patients with DDP-resistant ovarian cancer. To study how these drugs may overcome the intrinsic and/or acquired resistance of cancer cells to DDP, we investigated the effect of a combination of DDP with paclitaxel and a combination of DDP with SN-38 on three ovarian cancer cell lines, RTSG (intrinsically resistant cell line), KF (DDP-sensitive cell line), and KFra (acquired resistant cell line obtained from KF). We found that these combinations showed additive to synergistic antitumor activity. A time-dependent platinum (Pt) accumulation was observed in the DDP-sensitive KF cell line, while a decrease occurred in the KFra cell line. Little accumulation was observed in RTSG. Intracellular Pt accumulation was increased in all three cell lines by exposure to paclitaxel or SN-38. Ouabain, a Na+,K+-ATPase inhibitor, decreased Pt accumulation in KF and KFra cell lines and inhibited the paclitaxel- and SN-38-induced increases in Pt accumulation in these cell lines. When we assessed the mRNA levels of the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), which may be an efflux pump for DDP, the combination of paclitaxel or SN-38 with DDP down-regulated these levels, which are up-regulated by DDP alone. These results suggest that paclitaxel and SN-38 overcome DDP resistance of ovarian cell lines by controlling intracellular accumulation of DDP via both the influx and efflux systems.

N2  -  Paclitaxel has been found to be very effective against several human cancers, such as ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer and has received marketing approval for metastatic cancers. One of main problems with its use is its poor solubility, which makes irritant solubilitazion agents necessary. In previous research we demonstrated that linkage to human serum albumin (HSA) was useful to increase the in vivo performance of paclitaxel. In this article, in order to improve stability and solubility of paclitaxel conjugate, we linked covalently a monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) chain to HSA. New thioimidate mPEG derivatives, highly reactive and stable, were used and two different conjugates (with PEG of molecular mass 2 or 5 kDa) were prepared, purified and characterized. The antitumor activity of the free drug and conjugates was tested on three different tumor cell lines. The PEG grafted conjugates maintained high cytotoxicity, similar to that of ungrafted conjugates, with efficient cell binding and internalization followed by release of the drug inside the cell. The changes in pharmacokinetics and distribution of radio-labelled conjugates were evaluated by i.v. administration to mice and compared with those of the free drug and ungrafted conjugates. The total clearance was reduced (from 3.6 ml/h for free drug to 2.9, 1.97 and 1.41 for ungrafted, 2 and 5 kDa PEG conjugates, respectively). Organ uptake was reduced, in particular by liver and spleen. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) (p21) plays a crucial role in DNA repair, cell differentiation, and apoptosis through regulation of the cell cycle. A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells, which are sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel, express wild-type p53 and exhibit a p53-mediated increase in p21 in response to the chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream targets serine/threonine kinases AKT1 and AKT2 (AKT), are required for the full induction of p21 in A2780 cells treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Inactivation of the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway either by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or by expression of dominant negative AKT inhibited p21 expression but had no inhibitory effect on the expression of the proapoptotic protein BAX by cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment. In addition, overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active AKT in A2780 cells sustained the regulation of p21 induction or increased the level of p21 expression, respectively. Experiments with additional ovarian carcinoma cell lines revealed that PI3K is involved in the expression of p21 induced by cisplatin or paclitaxel in OVCAR-10 cells, which have wild-type p53, but not in OVCAR-5 cells, which lack functional p53. These data indicate that the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway mediates p21 expression and suggest that this pathway contributes to cell cycle regulation promoted by p53 in response to drug-induced stress. However, inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling did not result in significant alteration of the drug sensitivity of A2780 cells, suggesting that the cell death induced by cisplatin or paclitaxel proceeds independently of cell protective effects of PI3K and AKT.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a diterpenoid isolated from Taxus brevifolia, approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers. Due to its low solubility in water, it is clinically administered dissolved in Cremophor EL, (polyethoxylated castor oil) and ethanol, which cause serious side effects. Inclusion of paclitaxel in liposomal formulations has proved to be a good approach to eliminating this vehicle and improving the drug's antitumor efficacy. We prepared different conventional and PEGylated liposomes containing paclitaxel and determined encapsulation efficiency, physical stability and drug leakage in human plasma. The best conventional liposome formulation was composed of ePC/PG 9:1, while for PEGylated liposomes the best composition was ePC/PG/CHOL/PEG5000-DPPE 9:1:2:0.7. PEGylated liposomes were found to be less stable during storage than the corresponding conventional liposomes and to have lower drug release in human plasma at 37degreeC. In vitro cytotoxic activities were evaluated on HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma and MeWo melanoma cell lines. After 2 and 48 h, conventional liposomes had the same cytotoxicity as free paclitaxel, while PEGylated liposomes were as active as free drug, only after 48 h. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were evaluated in Balb/c mice after i.v. injection of paclitaxel, formulated in Cremophor EL or in conventional or in PEGylated liposomes. Encapsulation of paclitaxel in conventional liposomes produced marked differences over the free drug pharmacokinetics. PEGylated liposomes were long-circulating liposomes, with an increased t(1/2) beta 48.6 h, against t(1/2) beta 9.27 h of conventional liposomes. Biodistribution studies showed a considerable decrease in drug uptake in MPS-containing organs (liver and spleen) at 0.5 and 3 h after injection with PEGylated compared to conventional liposomes.

N2  -  In an attempt to define the molecular changes associated with the paclitaxel-resistant phenotype in human cancer, a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3(TR), was established through stepwise selection in increasing paclitaxel concentrations. SKOV-3(TR) was cross- resistant to doxorubicin and vincristine and overexpressed multidrug resistance gene 1 but not multidrug resistance associated protein. SKOV-3(TR) and the paclitaxel-sensitive SKOV-3 parent line were characterized using human cDNA array technology that examined expression of a wide variety of genes involved in cell growth, signal transduction, cell death, and immune function, cDNA probes from reverse transcribed mRNAs of both paclitaxel- resistant and parent cells were compared to identify genes differentially expressed in the paclitaxel-resistant cells. Of 588 different human cDNA transcripts compared, 6 genes were found to be markedly decreased, and 12 genes increased in the resistant subline. Northern analysis and/or reverse transcription-PCR confirmed that 12 of these 18 genes were over- or underexpressed in SKOV-3(TR). In addition, at least eight of the genes were found differentially expressed in several other paclitaxel- and/or doxorubicin-resistant cell lines, both those with increased multidrug resistance expression and those without. Included in the set of overexpressed genes were the cytokines/chemokines interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. ELISA assays confirm that mRNA overexpression of these cytokine/chemokines was associated with the increased secretion of these molecules in the tissue culture supernatant. Evaluation of supernatants from an expanded collection of paclitaxel- and Adriamycin-resistant cell lines demonstrated that all of the resistant lines had significant overexpression of at least one cytokine/chemokine as compared with their drug-sensitive parent line. The overexpression of these cytokines seemed to be stable and associated with a drug-resistant phenotype with only a modest induction of cytokine expression in the parent line with short-term paclitaxel exposure. These findings suggest that the development of paclitaxel resistance is accompanied by multiple changes in gene expression including stable alterations in selective chemokine and cytokine expression. The role these associated genetic changes have in the drug-resistant phenotype is discussed.

N2  -  Combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel with a platinum-based regimen is currently the standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer after surgical cytoreduction. Whereas cisplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy has shown significant efficacy over previous drug combinations in ovarian cancer, 20-30% of patients fail to respond to this combination. These patients are deemed cisplatin-paclitaxel resistant, although it is unclear whether the tumors are resistant to one or both drugs. Because the options available to ovarian cancer patients for second-line therapy are limited, and knowing that mechanistic differences exist between cisplatin and paclitaxel, we assessed the efficacy of combination drug therapy on cisplatin-resistant (cisplatin(R)) ovarian cancer cells. We found that paclitaxel induced apoptosis in cisplatin(R) cells as well as in the cisplatin-sensitive parental cell lines. In cisplatin(R) C-13 cells, the concomitant addition of cisplatin blocked paclitaxel-induced apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation assays, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Paclitaxel-induced multimininucleation was also inhibited when the cells were exposed sequentially to paclitaxel and then cisplatin. Cisplatin did not block paclitaxel-induced stabilization of microtubules or prevent paclitaxel- induced loss of Bcl-2 expression in cisplatin(R) cells. Conversely, paclitaxel did not inhibit p53 protein accumulation by cisplatin. These results suggest that cisplatin blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis at a point downstream of Bcl-2 degradation and independent of microtubule stabilization. Our research shows that cisplatin can inhibit the effectiveness of paclitaxel in cisplatin(R) cell lines. Therefore, the establishment of a clinical protocol to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel alone versus another second- line regimen in patients with cisplatin-paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer is warranted.

N2  -  SCH58500 is an agent for gene therapy of cancer, consisting of a replication-deficient type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) expressing the human p53 tumor suppressor gene (Ad5/p53). An important question about the use of Ad5/p53 gene therapy is how to achieve the therapeutically effective delivery of an Ad5/p53 vector to the tumor. We wanted to determine the effective depth of penetration of an Ad5/p53 vector by dosing the vector in an experimental human xenograft/SCID model. To assess depth of penetration, we developed a novel methodology for scanning tissue sections by laser scanning cytometry (LSC). SCID mice were given intraperitoneal injections of either p53(null) SK-OV-3 human ovarian tumor cells or p53(mut) DU-145 human prostate tumor cells to establish xenograft solid tumors. Mice were then dosed once or twice at 24-hour intervals by intraperitoneal injection with SCH58500 (Ad5/p53), an adenovirus construct expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad5/beta-gal), or a buffer control. Additional groups of mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg paclitaxel either alone or coadministered with Ad5/p53. Twenty-four hours after each last dose, the human solid tumor xenograft and relevant mouse tissue were removed from each mouse for the analysis of Ad5/p53 penetration. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for beta-galactosidase protein revealed a depth of penetration of between 1 and 10 cells from the tumor surface. In some mice, hepatocytes in the periportal regions of liver lobules were also positive, indicating systemic absorption of adenovirus from the peritoneal cavity. IHC staining for p53 and p21 proteins in SK-OV-3 solid tumor xenografts revealed similar Ad/p53 penetration. LSC was used to map and quantitate apoptosis in both tumor and liver tissue biopsies, with over 450,000 nuclei from liver tissue and 150,000 nuclei from tumor tissue being evaluated. LSC analysis demonstrated a high level of apoptosis in the tumors that had been removed from Ad5/p53-dosed mice (12.7-19.7%). This level of apoptosis was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than was observed for liver tissues taken from Ad5/p53-dosed mice (2.7-8.0%) or tumor tissues taken from either Ad5/beta-gal-dosed mice (3.0-6.4%) or buffer control-dosed mice (3.0- 5.3%). Scan bit maps from the extensive LSC analyses confirmed that apoptosis was present to about the same depth (1-10 cells) as had been identified by IHC for beta-galactosidase, p53, and p21 proteins. Paclitaxel coadministered with Ad5/p53 had no effect on Ad5 penetration into solid tumors in vivo as measured by IHC for p53 or p21 protein. However, the combination therapy did cause an elevation in the number of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis.

N2  -  We previously reported the pharmacodynamics of antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of paclitaxel in histocultures of bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate tumors obtained from patients. This study examined the relationship between paclitaxel pharmacodynamics and tumor pathobiological parameters [i.e., stage, grade, proliferation status, expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), p53, and Bcl-2]. Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical methods. The drug sensitivity rank order of the five tumor types is as follows: prostate > head and neck = bladder > breast > ovarian for the antiproliferative effect and breast = ovarian = head and neck > prostate = bladder for the apoptotic effect. When the pathobiological parameters were considered as single parameters, the antiproliferative effect was inversely correlated with tumor stage, grade, labeling index (LI), and expression of Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 (P < 0.05 in all cases). The apoptotic effect was positively correlated with Pgp expression, LI, and tumor grade (P < 0.01) but was not related to tumor stage and expression of p53 and Bcl-2 (P > 0.2). Results of multivariate analysis indicated that the maximum antiproliferative effect was best predicted by the combination of tumor stage and expression of Pgp and p53 (inverse correlation) and that the maximum apoptotic effect was best predicted by the combination of tumor LI and Pgp expression (positive correlation). In summary, these results indicate that the two major effects of paclitaxel in human solid tumors, i.e., antiproliferation and apoptosis, correlate with different tumor properties. The second finding that drug-induced apoptosis was equal or higher in tumors that expressed Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 compared to tumors that did not express these proteins supports the use of paclitaxel in treating Pgp-, p53- and Bcl-2-positive tumors.

N2  -  Tumor cells grown as multicellular spheroids are known to be intrinsically more resistant to a large and diverse array of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs compared to the same cells grown as dispersed monolayer cell cultures. Some drugs, however, seem relatively insensitive to this multicellular drug resistance, e.g., cisplatinum. Whether the cytotoxic effects of Taxol, an anticancer drug of growing importance in the treatment of breast and ovarian carcinomas, are diminished by multicellular growth conditions is unknown. To study this question, we examined the relative sensitivity of a panel of four different human ovarian carcinoma cell lines to either Taxol or cisplatinum. Upon exposure to Taxol, all the cell lines manifested a relative drug-resistant phenotype when grown as multicellular tumor spheroids, compared to the same cells grown as sparse monolayer cultures. This multicellular-dependent drug-resistant phenotype was not observed when the same cells were exposed to cisplatinum for an equivalent length of time. Monolayer but not spheroid cultures exposed to Taxol demonstrated an accumulation of cells at G2-M and a sub-G1 apoptotic region. In addition, Taxol-induced apoptosis was detected in monolayer conditions but not in the spheroid cultures. The relative sensitivity of the monolayer cell cultures was associated with a decrease in bcI-X1, protein levels after Taxol exposure, an effect not observed in drug-exposed spheroids. Taken together, these results suggest that some aspects of intrinsic Taxol resistance in ovarian carcinoma may be due to multicellular- dependent or -associated mechanisms. This raises the possibility of using antiadhesive agents to reverse multicellular-dependent Taxol resistance in certain circumstances as a potential means of increasing the initial efficiency of Taxol therapy against ovarian carcinoma.

N2  -  Taxol-resistant clones from a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (2008) were selected by an initial exposure to 0.05 muM (2008/13) or 0.5 muM (2008/17) taxol. Thereafter, a series of clones with increasing taxol resistance were derived from the 2008/17 and 2008/13 cells by stepwise sequential exposure to increasing concentrations of taxol. The 2008/17 clones displayed a classical P-glycoprotein-mediated drug-resistance phenotype. In contrast, the 2008/13 clones followed the classical P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance phenotype until a 245-fold taxol-resistant clone (2008/13/2) was obtained, which was followed by a further increase in the degree of resistance but significant down-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in the 252-fold taxol-resistant 2008/13/4 cells. This clone (2008/13/4) also accumulated significantly higher intracellular levels of taxol than those expressing the P-glycoprotein. No correlation between the expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein and taxol resistance was observed. Verapamil increased the sensitivity of all drug-resistant clones to taxol, and this was probably related to the ability of verapamil to increase the intracellular concentration of taxol (except in the case of 2008/13/4 cells). The 2008/17 clones were highly cross-resistant to Adriamycin, etoposide, and vincristine. They also displayed a low level of cross-resistance to camptothecin but were not cross-resistant to cisplatin. The taxol-resistant 2008/13 clones displayed a similar pattern of cross-resistance for all drugs (except Adriamycin). The 2008/13 clones were only 2- to 4-fold cross-resistant to Adriamycin. The levels of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin were similar in the parental 2008 and taxol-resistant 2008/13/4 cells. Furthermore, the in vitro binding of [3H]taxol to semipurified microtubule preparations derived from the parental 2008 and the taxol-resistant 2008/13/2 and 2008/13/4 cells was similar. These results show that in human ovarian carcinoma cells resistance to taxol can be acquired via as yet undescribed mechanisms.

N2  -  Epothilones A and B, natural products with minimal structural analogy to taxoids, have effects similar to those of paclitaxel (Taxol) in cultured cells and on microtubule protein, but differ from paclitaxel in retaining activity in multidrug-resistant cells. We examined interactions of the epothilones with purified tubulin and additional cell lines, including a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma line with an altered beta-tubulin. The epothilones, like paclitaxel, induced tubulin to form microtubules at low temperatures and without GTP and/or microtubule-associated proteins. The epothilones are competitive inhibitors of the binding of [3H]paclitaxel to tubulin polymers. The apparent K(i) values for epothilones A and B were 1.4 and 0.7 muM by Hanes analysis and 0.6 and 0.4 muM by Dixon analysis. In the paclitaxel-sensitive human cell lines we examined, epothilone B had greater antiproliferative activity than epothilone A or paclitaxel, while epothilone A was usually less active than paclitaxel. A multidrug-resistant colon carcinoma line and the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian line retained sensitivity to the epothilones. With Potorous tridactylis kidney epithelial (PtK2) cells examined by indirect immunofluorescence, microtubule bundles appeared more rapidly following epothilone B treatment, and there were different proportions of various mitotic aberrations following treatment with different drugs.

N2  -  Camptothecin (CPT) and taxol are secondary metabolites found in the stembark of Camptotheca acuminata, a native of China, and Taxus brevifolia, found in the northwest Pacific coastal region of the USA, respectively. The compounds were isolated through bioassay-guided fractionation of various extracts and through chromatographic fractions. Their unique and hitherto unknown structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and X-ray analysis. Both compounds have unique mechanisms of antitumor activity; CPT uniquely inhibits an enzyme, topoisomerase I, involved in DNA replication, while taxol binds to a protein, tubulin, thus inhibiting cell division. Taxol has been called the best new anticancer agent developed from natural products, showing particular efficacy against ovarian cancer. CPT and analogs singly or combined with cisplatinum show efficacy against solid tumors, breast, lung, and colorectal, which hitherto have been unaffected by most cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

N2  -  Taxol stabilizes microtubules, prevents tubulin depolymerization, and promotes tubulin bundling and is one of the most effective drugs fur the treatment of metastatic breast and ovarian cancer. Although its interaction with tubulin has been well characterized, the mechanism by which taxol induces growth arrest and cytoxicity is not well understood. Herein, we show that taxol induced dose- and time-dependent accumulation of the cyclin inhibitor p21(WAF1) in both p53 wild-type and p53-null cells, although the degree of induction was greater in cells expressing wild-type p53. In MCF7 cells, wild-type p53 protein was also induced after taxol treatment, and this induction was mediated primarily by increased protein stability. Taxol induced both p21(WAF1) and wild-type p53 optimally in MCF7 cells after 20- 24-h exposure with an EC503 of 5 nM. In p53-null PC3M cells, p21(WAF1) was similarly induced after 24-h exposure to taxol. Coincident with these biochemical effects, taxol altered the electrophoretic mobility of c-raf-1 and stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase. Previous depletion of c- raf-1 inhibited both the p21(WAF1) and p53-inducing properties of taxol, as well as the activation of MAP kinase. These data suggest that induction of p21(WAF1) by taxol requires c-raf-1 activity, but that it is not strictly dependent on wild-type p53. Furthermore, the ability of taxol to both induce wild-type p53 in MCF7 cells and activate MAP kinase is also dependent on c- raf-1 expression.

N2  -  Taxol, an inhibitor of microtubule disaggregation, is used in the therapy of breast, ovarian, and other human malignancies. The toxicity of taxol administration is due in part to the polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremaphor) vehicle in which it is administered; taxol embryotoxicity appears also to be partially attributable to vehicle toxicity. Liposome encapsulation is a novel vehicle for drug administration. The administration of taxol encapsulated in liposomes was evaluated in the chick embryo. Albumen injections of taxol doses up to 30 mug/egg were used to characterize dose-response curves for free and liposome-encapsulated taxol, compared to liposome-only and saline-injected control eggs. Sixty percent embryotoxicity (death or malformation) occurred with taxol doses of 1.5 mug/ egg. A 20-fold higher dose was necessary to produce the same degree of toxicity with liposome-encapsulated taxol. Curve-fitting equations were used to estimate median effective doses (ED50s) and slope functions of the dose response curves. The ED50 for taxol was more than an order of magnitude lower than that for liposome-encapsulated taxol. Estimated slope functions for the two dosage forms of taxol were the same, suggesting similar mechanisms of toxicity. The toxicity of liposomes alone was low.

N2  -  Taxol, a natural product initially isolated from the stem bark of the western yew Taxus brevifolia, is undergoing phase II and III evaluation due to its reported activity against a variety of tumors. Previous studies have described correlations between plasma concentrations and toxicity when taxol is given (a) at lower doses, (b) for shorter infusion times, and (c) without granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Because the 24-h infusion schedule is most commonly used in current clinical trials, we attempted to correlate steady-state plasma concentrations of taxol achieved with a 24-h continuous i.v. infusion with toxicities and responses. Plasma samples from 48 refractory ovarian cancer patients were obtained 1-2 h prior to the end of the first taxol infusion. Taxol concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Interpatient variation of taxol plasma concentrations was small (mean +/- SD, 0.85 +/- 0.21 muM). Total taxol body clearance was 256 +/- 72 ml min-1 m-2 (mean +/- SD). Taxol plasma protein binding was 88.4% +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SD, n = 9). Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, mainly leukopenia, occurred in 92% of the patients. The leukopenia was transient and did not warrant a reduction in the dose of taxol. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 8% of the patients. No severe hypersensitivity reaction or grade 3-4 neurotoxicity was observed. Correlations of plasma concentrations and toxicities were not feasible due to the high frequency of hematologic effects and the low frequency of nonhematologic toxicity. The low degree of interpatient variation in plasma concentrations hindered the development of correlations with response.
