N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) poses significant challenges due to its high mortality, making it a critical area of research. This retrospective observational study aimed to analyze real-world data from comprehensive genome profiling (CGP) of Japanese patients with PDAC, mainly focusing on differences in gene detection rates among panels and the implications for homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status. This study enrolled 2568 patients with PDAC who had undergone CGP between June 2019 and December 2021 using data from the nationwide Center for Cancer Genomics and Advanced Therapeutics database. Two types of CGP assays (tissue and liquid biopsies) were compared and a higher detection rate of genetic abnormalities in tissue specimens was revealed. HRD-related gene alterations were detected in 23% of patients, with BRCA1/2 mutations accounting for 0.9% and 2.9% of patients, respectively. Treatment outcome analysis indicated that patients with BRCA1/2 mutations had a longer time to treatment discontinuation with FOLFIRINOX than gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as first-line therapy (9.3 vs. 5.6 months, p = 0.028). However, no significant differences were observed in the treatment response among the other HRD-related genes. Logistic regression analysis identified younger age and family history of breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers as predictive factors for HRD-related gene alterations. Despite the lack of progression-free survival data and the inability to discriminate between germline and somatic mutations, this study provides valuable insights into the clinical implications of CGP in Japanese patients with PDAC. Further research is warranted to optimize panel selection and elucidate the efficacy of platinum-based therapies depending on the HRD status. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  -  Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary represents a rare and malignant extrahepatic tumor that shares morphological and immunophenotypic similarities with hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the ambiguous histomorphology and aggressive behavior, the diagnosis and management of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary present unique challenges. Here, we present a 67-year-old woman with massive ascites and disseminated peritoneal implants at initial diagnosis. She was treated with six cycles of neoadjuvant therapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel + nedaplatin + bevacizumab) and a debulking surgery, followed by eight cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel + carboplatin + bevacizumab). Elaborate pathology workup found significant involvement of angiogenesis in the tumor and confirmed the diagnosis via immunohistochemistry. Further molecular characterization of the tumor by whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel heterozygous germline mutation (NM_000057.2, c.1290_1291delinsATCAGGCCTCCATAG, p.Y430fs1) in gene BLM, likely pathogenic, suggesting a potential candidate for Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. For the maintenance therapy, she received a combination of the PARP inhibitor niraparib and the antiangiogenic anlotinib. As of now, the patient has achieved a partial response, with no apparent evidence of disease progression observed nearly 30 months. Our study sheds light on the WES-based profiling in rare cancers to screen for any treatable targets with otherwise no standard therapeutic options. The promising results with the niraparib-anlotinib combination suggest its potential as a maintenance therapy option for hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the ovary, which warrants validation in future larger cohort.

N2  -  Taxanes are a diverse class of chemotherapeutic agents comprising paclitaxel, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which work by stabilization of the microtubules. The resulting cell cycle inhibition during the G2/M phase activates the cellular apoptosis pathways. Paclitaxel was the first drug from this class that got FDA approval in 1992 for treating ovarian cancer after failure of first-line or later therapy. Subsequently, it was approved for metastatic breast cancer, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and bladder cancer. FDA first approved docetaxel in 1996 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Currently, it is approved for use in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. Cabazitaxel is being extensively prescribed for docetaxel-resistant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Nab-paclitaxel is used in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Despite forming the chemotherapy backbone of various malignancies, the use of taxanes is hindered by their side effects profile. Often the side effects are increased when these drugs are prescribed in combination with other medicines like platinum agents and doxorubicin. The side effects vary between different taxanes, but the common ones include myelosuppression, neuropathy, and hypersensitivity reactions. Taxanes have been known to cause (upper) gastrointestinal bleeding. The unique toxicities of paclitaxel include cardiac conduction abnormalities, specifically bradycardia, alopecia, nail discoloration, and rarely hepatitis and pneumonitis. Docetaxel leads to characteristic fluid retention, skin toxicities, and stomatitis. Cabazitaxel toxicities consist of infections, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. Nab-paclitaxel is characterized by a lack of hypersensitivity reactions but can cause nausea and vomiting, alopecia, arthralgia, myalgia, and elevation of liver enzymes.

N2  -  The goal of this study was to assess the safety of nab-paclitaxel in patients with ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer who had an allergic reaction to paclitaxel. We performed a retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer with an allergic reaction to paclitaxel who were subsequently treated with nab-paclitaxel at the Mayo Clinic Florida from January 2016 to June 2023. A total of 43 patients with ovarian cancer (31) or endometrial cancer (12) and a paclitaxel allergic reaction were identified. All patients were pre-medicated against allergic reactions prior to paclitaxel and subsequent nab-paclitaxel. Allergic reactions to paclitaxel were mild in fourteen patients (33%), moderate in twenty-five patients (58%) and severe in four (9%) patients. None of the 43 patients had an allergic reaction to subsequent nab-paclitaxel. Our data suggests that the administration of nab-paclitaxel to endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer patients with allergic reactions to paclitaxel is safe and should be considered a preferable treatment option in this clinical situation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer has an abysmal prognosis with limited treatment options. Poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP), angiogenesis, and immune checkpoint inhibitors might improve the outcomes of platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer, but accurate patient selections for those therapies remain a significant clinical challenge., PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biomarker-driven combinatorial therapies of pamiparib, tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab-paclitaxel in platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer., STUDY HYPOTHESIS: A precision medicine combination of PARP inhibitors, anti-angiogenic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy will improve disease outcomes of platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer by accounting for genomic and immunologic features., TRIAL DESIGN: The BRIGHT Trial is a prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase II, umbrella study planning to enroll 160 patients with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer from 11 clinical centers in China. Patients are assigned to one of three experimental arms based on biomarkers. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations will receive pamiparib plus bevacizumab (arm 1, n=40) regardless of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count. Patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 (BRCAwt) and >=3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive the combination of tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab-paclitaxel (arm 2, n=50), while BRCAwt patients with <3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive bevacizumab plus dose-dense nab-paclitaxel (arm 3, n=50). After completing patient enrollment in arm 2, another 20 BRCAwt patients with >=3 CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes count will be included as an arm 2 expansion. Treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, and all adverse events will be recorded., MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Eligible patients include those aged >=18 with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian cancer, platinum-resistant recurrence, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1., PRIMARY ENDPOINT: Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigators by the RECIST 1.1 criteria., SAMPLE SIZE: 160 patients., ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS: Recruitment is estimated to be completed by 2024 and results may be published by 2027., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05044871.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality among gynecologic cancers, primarily because it typically is diagnosed at a late stage and because of the development of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Improving outcomes in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is a substantial unmet need. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by cortisol has been shown to suppress the apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents, limiting their efficacy. Selective GR modulation may be able to counteract cortisol's antiapoptotic effects, enhancing chemotherapy's efficacy. A previous phase 2 study has shown that adding intermittently dosed relacorilant, a selective GR modulator, to nab-paclitaxel improved outcomes, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with minimal added toxicity, in women with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The ROSELLA study aims to confirm and expand on these findings in a larger population., METHODS: ROSELLA is a phase 3, randomized, 2-arm, open-label, global multicenter study in women with recurrent, platinum-resistant, high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Eligible participants have received 1 to 3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including >=1 prior line of platinum therapy and prior treatment with bevacizumab, with documented progressive disease or intolerance to the most recent therapy. There is no biomarker-based requirement for participant selection. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive intermittently dosed relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS, investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks, and cancer antigen 125 response. The study is also evaluating safety and patient-reported outcomes., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05257408; European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database Identifier: 2022-000662-18.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (PACC) is a rare pancreatic neoplasm. Recently, molecular analysis revealed that PACC shows a high frequency of the BRCA1/2 mutation and is likely to be considered a cancer associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Hereditary cancers, including HBOC, are characterized by multifocal and/or metachronous tumors. However, no case reports exist of germline BRCA1-mutated synchronous and metachronous PACC., CASE: A 58-year-old man was diagnosed with synchronous and metachronous PACC at the age of 56 and underwent two surgeries. Ten months after the second surgery, the patient developed multiple liver metastases. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel therapy was administered as first-line chemotherapy. After seven cycles, computed tomography examination revealed progressive disease (PD). Therefore, modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) was administered as second- line chemotherapy. After 19 cycles of mFFX, comprehensive cancer genomic profiling (CGP) identified a BRCA1 pathogenic variant that was confirmed to be germline origin. Accordingly, we treated the patient with olaparib; however, he was diagnosed with PD after 4 months. He subsequently died 5 years and 9 months after the initial surgery, and 3 years and 10 months after chemotherapy. Based on the genetic data of the patients, his family members received genetic counseling followed by cascade testing. Consequently, the same gBRCA1 pathogenic variant was detected in the son and his surveillance for HBOC-related cancers was initiated., CONCLUSION: We diagnosed a 58-year-old man with a synchronous and metachronous PACC with germline BRCA1 pathogenic variant. Considering that PACC is likely to have BRCA1/2 mutations responsible for HBOC, we need to be aware of the possible presence of multifocal and/or metachronous tumors in patients with PACC. Additionally, patients with PACC should undergo genetic examinations, which would be beneficial in determining treatment strategies and health care for blood relatives.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Relacorilant (CORT125134, Corcept Therapeutics) is a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator, which reverses the glucocorticoid-mediated anti-apoptotic effects and restores the taxane chemosensitivity in epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Given those preclinical findings, relacorilant is currently under investigation in clinical trials in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer setting., AREAS COVERED: Already published preclinical and clinical evidence of relacorilant antitumor activity was analyzed and discussed. Ongoing clinical trials registered on clincaltrials.gov were also reported. The review aimed to summarize the status of relacorilant, the mechanism of action, the published and ongoing trials, and its safety and efficacy., EXPERT OPINION: Relacorilant combined with nab-paclitaxel, may represent a promising strategy for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. After preliminary positive results in terms of clinical efficacy, a randomized phase III trial is ongoing to confirm the findings from the published phase II study.

N2  -  Introduction and objective: The approach to patients with advanced or metastatic high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has evolved over time with the advent of new therapies and multimodal strategies. The objective of this consensus of experts is to generate national recommendations for the profiling and management of advanced or metastatic high-grade OEC, defined as stages III and IV of the "The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification at the time of diagnosis to base on the literature review that included international evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG). Material and methods: Eleven panelists (oncologists and gynecological oncologists) answered 8 questions about the profiling and management of advanced or metastatic ovarian epithelial carcinoma. The panelists were chosen for their academic profile and influence in national health institutions. Guidelines from the "ESMO Standardized Operating Procedures Consensus Conference" were used to develop the consensus. It was agreed that the level of agreement to accept a recommendation should be >= 80%. The document was peer reviewed. Results: Eight general recommendations are made, which are presented into five domains. Some of these recommendations are subdivided into specific recommendations. Initial treatment Recommendation 1.1 Complete primary cytoreduction (PCS) surgery is suggested as the initial therapy of choice for patients with high-grade or metastatic EOC, which should ideally be carried out in centers with experience, followed by adjuvant therapy. 1.2 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction surgery (ICS) is suggested in those who are unlikely to achieve a complete cytoreduction in PCS either due to unresectable metastatic disease or who present unresectability criteria (imaging, laparoscopic and/or by laparotomy) and that have been defined by a gynecological oncologist and patients with poor functional status and comorbidities according to the criteria of the multidisciplinary team (clinical oncology, gynecological oncology, radiology, etc.). Recommendation 2. In patients with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), in stage III locally advanced or metastatic, who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved a complete or partial response (cytoreduction with tumor residue < 2.5 mm), the use of Hyperthermic IntraPeritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) could be considered as an alternative to standard platinum-based adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy during interval cytoreductive surgery, after discussion in a multidisciplinary tumor board, at a center experienced in treating this type of patients. Use of genetic testing. Recommendation 3. It is suggested at the time of diagnosis to offer molecular genetic testing to all patients with high-grade advanced or metastatic EOC regardless of family history. Recommendation 4. It is suggested to offer genetic counseling, by qualified personnel, to all patients with high-grade advanced or metastatic EOC who are ordered genetic testing. Recommendation 5. It is suggested that all patients with advanced or metastatic high-grade EOC undergo a germ panel that includes the Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes 1/2 genes (BRCA 1/2) and the other susceptibility genes according to with institutional protocols and the availability of genetic testing panels; If it is negative, then somatic testing should be performed that includes the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status, regardless of family history. Adjuvant Therapy Recommendation 6. 6.1. It is suggested that all patients with advanced stage III/IV EOC, with PSC of (0-2), got adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy as standard treatment within six weeks after Prc. It is suggested paclitaxel/carboplatin. Recommendation 6.2. It is suggested to use standard chemotherapy base on platinum plus Bevacizumab as adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with high-risk disease (EOC stage IV or stage III with suboptimal tumor cytoreduction), following by bevacizumab as maintenance. The use of bevacizumab as maintenance therapy is not recommended if bevacizumab was not included in the first line of treatment. We suggested the dose used in GOG-0218 and ICON7 trials. Recommendation 6.3 It is suggested combined intravenous/intraperitoneal chemotherapy only for selected patients, with optimal cytoreduction (residual lesions < 1 cm), especially those without residual disease (R0) and who are evaluated in a multidisciplinary meeting. It is not considered standard treatment. Recommendation 6.4. 6.4.1 It is suggested to use Poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors such as olaparib or niraparib as maintenance after receiving first-line chemotherapy in patients with stage III/IV BRCA1/2 positive EOC who received platinumbased chemotherapy and obtained complete response/partial response (CR/PR), 6.4.2 It is suggested to use olaparib alone or in combination with bevacizumab or niraparib in patients with stage III/IV BRCA1/2 positive EOC who received platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and achieved CR/PR. 6.4.3 It is suggested to use niraparibin patients with stage III/IV BRCA1/2 negative or unknown EOC who received platinum-based chemotherapy and achieved CR/PR. 6.4.4 It is suggested to use bevacizumab or olaparib plus bevacizumab in patients with EOC stage III/IV BRCA1/2 negative or unknown (HRD positive) who received platinum-based chemotherapy plus bevacizumab and obtained CR/PR. Treatment of disease relapse Recommendation 7. Secondary cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy is suggested for selected patients with high-grade advanced EOC in first relapse, platinum-sensitive (platinum-free interval >= 6 months), positive "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie - AGO" score or "I-model" positive (< 4.7) with a potential resection to R0 in centers with access to optimal surgical and postoperative support. Note: Platinum-free interval and AGO score have only been developed as positive predictors of complete resection and not to exclude patients from surgery. Recommendation 8. 8.1 For patients with relapse advanced high-grade EOC platinum-sensitive, the following is suggested: Platinum-based combination chemotherapy: carboplatin/liposomal doxorubicin or carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel or carboplatin/docetaxel or carboplatin/gemcitabine) for six cycles. If combination therapy is not tolerated, give carboplatin or cisplatin alone. Combination chemotherapy (carboplatin/gemcitabine or carboplatin/paclitaxel or carboplatin/doxorubicin liposomal) plus bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab as maintenance (until progression or toxicity). Recommendation 8.2 For patients with relapsed advanced high-grade EOC platinum-resistant, it is suggested: Sequential treatment with chemotherapy, preferably with a non-platinum single agent (weekly paclitaxel or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or docetaxel or oral etoposide or gemcitabine or trabectidine or, topotecan). Weekly paclitaxel or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan could be administrate with or without bevacizumab. Other agents are considered potentially active (capecitabine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, pemetrexed, vinorelbine, cyclophosphamide) could be recommended for later lines. Hormone receptor-positive patients who do not tolerate or have no response to cytotoxic regimens may receive hormone therapy with tamoxifen or other agents, including aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and letrozole) or leuprolide acetate, or megestrol acetate. Patients with a performance score >= 3 should be considered only for best supportive care. Recommendation 8.3 Maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitors: It is suggested in patients with relapse advanced high-grade EOC stage III/IV BRCA1/2 (positive, negative or unknown) who have received two or more lines of platinum-based chemotherapy and have achieved CR/PR, use olaparib, niraparib or rucaparib. Niraparib could be useful in BRCA 1/2 +/-/unknown patients, as rucaparib, however, the latter does not yet have approval from the regulatory office in Colombia. Conclusions: It is expected that the recommendations issued in this consensus will contribute to improving clinical care, oncological impact, and quality of life of these women.

N2  -  PURPOSE: AB160 is a 160-nm nano-immunoconjugate consisting of nab-paclitaxel (ABX) nanoparticles noncovalently coated with bevacizumab (BEV) for targeted delivery into tissues expressing high levels of VEGF. Preclinical data showed that AB160 resulted in greater tumor targeting and tumor inhibition compared with sequential treatment with ABX then BEV. Given individual drug activity, we investigated the safety and toxicity of AB160 in patients with gynecologic cancers., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 3+3 phase I trial was conducted with three potential dose levels in patients with previously treated endometrial, cervical, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer to ascertain the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). AB160 was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (ABX 75-175 mg/m2, BEV 30-70 mg/m2). Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed., RESULTS: No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen among the three dose levels tested. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia, thromboembolic events, and leukopenia. DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2) was chosen as the RP2D. Seven of the 19 patients with measurable disease (36.8%) had confirmed partial responses (95% confidence interval, 16.3%-61.6%). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that AB160 allowed 50% higher paclitaxel dosing and that paclitaxel clearance mirrored that of therapeutic antibodies., CONCLUSIONS: The safety profile and clinical activity of AB160 supports further clinical testing in patients with gynecologic cancers; the RP2D is DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2).

N2  -  We report the case of a long-term-surviving adolescent and young adult patient with unresectable advanced gastric cancer for whom multidisciplinary treatment was effective. A 29-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further examination following a diagnosis of gastric cancer by a local physician. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a deep ulcerated lesion in the lower third of the stomach, and analysis of biopsy specimens revealed an adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast- enhanced computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening in the lower third of the stomach. The patient underwent distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, including resection of localized peritoneal metastases, followed by Roux-en- Y reconstruction. The pathological diagnosis was serosa-invading poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with 1 lymph node metastasis measuring 6.0x5.5 cm in the posterior wall of the lower third of the stomach and negative immunohistochemical staining for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The patient received postoperative chemotherapy with S-1 and oxaliplatin. She developed bilateral ovarian metastases measuring 13.0 cm and 7.8 cm after 17 months. The patient presented with severe lower abdominal pain and underwent an emergency bilateral ovarian metastasectomy, which revealed torsion of the right ovarian tumor, which had twisted twice on its pedicle, and a left ovarian mass. After the operation, 41 courses of ramucirumab with nab-paclitaxel were administered as a second-line treatment, and she received systemic drug treatment. Sixty months after the gastrectomy, the patient developed left hydronephrosis due to peritoneal metastases and was treated with nivolumab after ureteral stent replacement. No effective treatment was proposed in cancer multigene panel testing, and she died 66 months after the initial treatment because of disease progression. Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment, including surgical and local therapy for peritoneal dissemination based on drug therapy for unresectable advanced gastric cancer, may result in long-term survival. Further research and accumulation of such cases would lead to the development of novel treatments.

N2  -  Recently, the results of gastric cancer treatment have improved; however, its characteristics in adolescents and young adults are not well known. We report the case of a patient with advanced gastric cancer, Fanconi anemia (FA), and primary biliary cholangitis. A 26-year-old woman visited a local physician complaining of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed edematous changes with poor distension and circumferential thickened folds with erosions in the gastric body. Biopsy results of the lesion specimens revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall with irregular thickness, several nodules in the peritoneal cavity, and a mass lesion in the right ovary. We diagnosed the patient with T4N2M1 stage IV gastric cancer accompanied by peritoneal and ovarian metastases and initiated nivolumab with S-1 plus oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment regimen. Because of immune-related adverse events after one course of systemic treatment, the regimen was changed to ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as the second-line treatment. After three cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel with ramucirumab, the decreased platelet count did not recover, and her general condition gradually deteriorated. Comprehensive genome profiling using next-generation sequencing was performed to determine the feasibility of genotype-matched therapies. Alterations in FA complementation group A (FANCA) F1263del (49.1%) and E484Q (12.3%), which encode a key component of the multiprotein FA complex, were identified. The patient died 10 months after treatment initiation. In conclusion, when treating malignancies in adolescent and young adult patients, the genomic background should be considered. Copyright © 2023.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Despite therapeutic advances, outcomes for patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer remain poor. Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation with relacorilant may restore chemosensitivity and enhance chemotherapy efficacy., METHODS: This three-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776812) enrolled women with recurrent, platinum-resistant/refractory, high-grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian carcinosarcoma treated with <=4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to (1) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + intermittent relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab-paclitaxel); (2) nab-paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + continuous relacorilant (100 mg once daily); or (3) nab-paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab-paclitaxel was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment; objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were secondary end points., RESULTS: A total of 178 women were randomly assigned. Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; log-rank test P = .038; median follow-up, 11.1 months) and DOR (HR, 0.36; P = .006) versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy, while ORR was similar across arms. At the preplanned OS analysis (median follow-up, 22.5 months), the OS HR was 0.67 (P = .066) for the intermittent arm versus nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Continuous relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel showed numerically improved median PFS but did not result in significant improvement over nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Adverse events were comparable across study arms, with neutropenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue/asthenia being the most common grade >=3 adverse events., CONCLUSION: Intermittent relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel improved PFS, DOR, and OS compared with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. On the basis of protocol-prespecified Hochberg step-up multiplicity adjustment, the primary end point did not reach statistical significance (P < .025). A phase III evaluation of this regimen is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05257408).

N2  -  The efficacy of a single clinical nanodrug for cancer treatment is still unsatisfactory, especially for drug-resistant cancer. Herein, we applied a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) approach via dietary intervention to assist single clinical nanodrug for breast or ovarian cancer treatments instead of using multi-drug therapies which might cause adverse side effects. Specifically, we adopted Doxil or Abraxane to treat human breast tumor-bearing nude mice and Doxil to treat the human ovarian tumor and drug-resistant ovarian tumor-bearing nude mice under FMD conditions, respectively. According to the results, the FMD condition can promote the cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of a single nanodrug, reduce the ATP level in drug-resistant tumor cells to hinder drug efflux, normalize tumor blood vessels, relieve tumor hypoxia, and increase the accumulation of nanodrugs at tumor sites, thereby enhancing the therapeutic effects on these types of human cancers. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the FMD strategy of significance can become a practical, alternative, and promising assistant for single nanodrug for enhancing cancer therapy and clinical translation.

N2  -  There is substantial evidence that albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is effective and safe for the treatment of breast, lung and pancreatic cancers. However, it can still cause adverse effects by affecting cardiac enzymes, hepatic enzyme metabolism and blood routine related indicators, which affects the use of chemotherapy for a full course of treatment. However, there are no relevant clinical studies to systematically observe the effects and dynamics of albumin-bound paclitaxel on cardiac enzymes, liver enzyme metabolism, and routine blood-related indices. The purpose of our study was to determine the levels of serum creatinine (Cre), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), white blood cells (WBC) and hemoglobin (HGB) in cancer patients treated with albumin-conjugated paclitaxel. This study retrospectively analyzed 113 patients with cancer. Patients who had received two cycles of nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m2 (administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle) were selected. Serum Cre, AST, ALT, LDH, CK, and CK-MB activities, WBC counts, and HGB levels were measured before and after treatment with two cycles. Fourteen cancer types were analyzed. The distribution of cancer types in patients was mainly concentrated in lung, ovarian, and breast cancer. Nab-paclitaxel treatment markedly decreased Cre, AST, LDH, and CK activities in the serum and WBC counts and HGB levels, respectively. Serum Cre and CK activities and HGB levels were remarkably downregulated at baseline compared to healthy controls. Patients receiving nab-paclitaxel treatment cause metabolic disorders in tumor patients by reducing the decrease of Cre, AST, LDH, CK, CK-MB, WBC and HGB indexes, thus inducing the occurrence of cardiovascular events, hepatotoxic events and fatigue and other symptoms. Therefore, for tumor patients, although receiving nab-paclitaxel improves the anti-tumor effect, it is still necessary to closely monitor the changes of related enzymatic and routine blood indicators, so as to detect and intervene at an early stage.

N2  -  Though the great success of paclitaxel, the variable response of patients to the drug limits its clinical utility and the precise mechanisms underlying the variable response to paclitaxel remain largely unknown. This study aims to verify the role and the underlying mechanisms of CD147 in paclitaxel resistance. Immunostaining was used to analyze human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer tissues. RNA-sequencing was used to identify downstream effectors. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed to determine protein interactions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed to measure the speed of microtubule turnover. Xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate sensitivity of cancer cells to paclitaxel in vivo. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that silencing CD147 sensitized the cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. CD147 protected cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis regardless of p53 status. Truncation analysis showed that the intracellular domain of CD147 (CD147ICD) was indispensable for CD147-regulated sensitivity to paclitaxel. Via screening the interacting proteins of CD147ICD, Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) was identified to interact with CD147ICD via its C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that RanBP1 mediated CD147-regulated microtubule stability and dynamics as well as response to paclitaxel treatment. These results demonstrated that CD147 regulated paclitaxel response by interacting with the C-terminal tail of RanBP1 and targeting CD147 may be a promising strategy for preventing paclitaxel resistant.

N2  -  Gynaecological cancers: malignancies of the cervix, uterus, ovaries, vagina and vulva, are responsible for over 1.1 million new cancer cases and almost half a million deaths annually. Ovarian cancer in particular is difficult to treat due to often being diagnosed at a late stage, and the incidence of uterine and vulvar malignancies are both on the rise. The field of nanomedicine is beginning to introduce drugs into the clinic for oncological applications exemplified by the liposomal drugs, Doxil and Myocet, the nanoparticle, Abraxane and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), Kadcyla and Adcetris. With many more agents currently undergoing clinical trials, the field of nanomedicine promises to have a significant impact on cancer therapy. This review considers the state of the art for nanomedicines currently on the market and those being clinically evaluated for the treatment of gynaecological cancers. In particular, it focuses on ADCs and presents a methodology for their rational design and evaluation.

N2  -  Taxol( R) remained as the mainstay therapeutic agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer, however recurrence rate is still high. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a subset of cells in the bulk of tumors and play a central role in inducing drug resistance and recurrence. Furthermore, cancer metabolism has been an area under intensive investigation, since accumulating evidence has shown that CSCs and cancer metabolism are closely linked, an effect named as metabolic reprogramming. In this work, we aimed to investigate the impacts of a novel liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel (Nano-Taxol) on the stemness phenotype and metabolic reprogramming. A paclitaxel-resistant cell line (TR) was established at first. Tumor growth was induced in the mice peritoneal cavity by inoculation of TR cells. A 2x2 factorial experiment was designed to test the therapeutic efficacy in which factor 1 represented the comparison of drugs (Taxol( R) versus Nano-Taxol), while factor 2 represented the delivery route (intravenous versus intraperitoneal delivery). In this work, we found that intraperitoneal delivery of Nano-Taxol redirects metabolic reprogramming, from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, and effectively suppresses cancer stem cells. Also, intraperitoneal delivery of Nano-Taxol led to a significantly better control of tumor growth compared with intravenous delivery of Taxol( R) (current standard treatment). This translational research may serve as a novel pathway for the drug development of nanomedicine. In the future, this treatment modality may be extended to treat several relevant cancers that have been proved to be suitable for the loco-regional delivery of therapeutic agents, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer.

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer is the most malignant gynecological disease, which seriously threatens female physical and mental health. Paclitaxel is a first-line chemotherapy drug in the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer, but drug resistance has become an important factor affecting the survival of ovarian cancer patients. However, the main mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in ovarian cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the Integrated Gene Expression Database (GEO) dataset using comprehensive bioinformatics tools to provide new therapeutic strategies and search for prognostic targets for ovarian cancer. Methods: Ovarian cancer related genes were extracted from GSE18520 by bioinformatics method. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by differential analysis, and related genes and functions were elucidated. The key gene CRTC2 was identified by prognostic analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of CRTC2 in chemotherapy-resistant and chemotherapy-sensitive ovarian cancer tissues. Functional analysis (cell assay) confirmed the role of CRTC2 in paclitaxel resistance. Autophagy related proteins were detected by Western blot. Autophagy flux analysis was performed using the GFP/RFP-LC3 adenovirus reporter. Results: A total of 3,852 DEGs were identified in the GEO microarray dataset. Key genes were screened by prognostic analysis. We found that CRTC2 was highly expressed in chemoresistant tissues of ovarian cancer. In 110 patients with ovarian cancer, high expression of CRTC2 was associated with poorer prognostic factors and shorter survival. At the same time, we found that CRTC2 can promote the proliferation and invasion ability of ovarian cancer cells. In addition, CRTC2 can affect the expression of PI3K, AKT, autophagic flux and sensitivity to paclitaxel chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. Conclusion:  CRTC2 can affect autophagy partially through PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and then affect the sensitivity of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel chemotherapy. CRTC2 may be a potential predictor or target for ovarian cancer therapy. Copyright © The author(s).

N2  -  Background: Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological cancers, with the most advanced disease and poor survival. Although BRCA genes play a key role in maintaining genomic stability and providing the possibility of clinically individualized treatments, with the emergence of new and more appropriate treatment options, new treatment-related adverse events are challenging and difficult for clinicians. Case presentation: An 80-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with stage IIIC ovarian high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (CT3cN1MX) with BRCA2 as the causative gene. She underwent three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel 400 mg and carboplatin 450 mg before surgery. Chest HRCT prior to chemotherapy demonstrated bilateral interstitial pneumonia. During chemotherapy, there were four episodes of dry cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and three episodes of bone marrow suppression. The symptoms became intermittent and progressively worse, and after three sessions of empirical cough and phlegm relief, oxygen inhalation, corticosteroids, anti-infectives, and leukopenia therapy, the symptoms became intermittent and progressively worse. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis came a week after the third round of chemotherapy. After a strong dose of corticosteroids and nintedanib anti-fibrosis therapy, the pulmonary symptoms abated, and intermediate tumor starvation was performed. The combination therapy was subsequently discontinued, and the patient experienced significant relief from pulmonary symptoms. Treatment response was positive following single-agent nab-paclitaxel 400 mg chemotherapy in combination with nintedanib 150 mg anti-fibrosis therapy. Conclusion:  In this report, we describe a rare case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis associated with the use of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in ovarian cancer. During treatment, it is necessary to maintain a high level of vigilance for patients with interstitial pneumonia and engage the attention of clinicians to improve medication safety. Early diagnosis and anti-fibrosis therapy can reverse lung damage. Copyright © 2023 Shen, Wen, Lin and Su.

N2  -  Ovarian carcinoma is a common malignancy with a grim prognosis and a high mortality rate. Here, we report a rare case of an Iranian woman with four episodes of recurrent metastatic ovarian carcinoma. She was initially diagnosed with stage IVa high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (HGSOC), treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin and capecitabine, followed by total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Two years later, she developed cerebellar metastasis and received whole-brain radiotherapy and paclitaxel-carboplatin. Eighteen months later, she had peritoneal metastasis and had sequential gemcitabine-carboplatin-paclitaxel. One year later, she had splenic metastasis, treated with splenectomy and adjuvant carboplatin and nano-albumin bond paclitaxel. The patient remains in remission until now, 11 months after completing the most recent regimen. This report emphasizes the potential to successfully use chemoradiotherapy with sequential courses of platinum-based agents in patients with recurrent metastatic HGSOC.

N2  -  Guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) is known as an interferon-gamma-induced GTPase. Here, we used genetically modified ovarian cancer (OC) cells to study the role of GBP1. The data generated show that GBP1 inhibition constrains the clonogenic potential of cancer cells. In vivo studies revealed that GBP1 overexpression in tumors promotes tumor progression and reduces median survival, whereas GBP1 inhibition delayed tumor progression with longer median survival. We employed proteomics-based thermal stability assay (CETSA) on GBP1 knockdown and overexpressed OC cells to study its molecular functions. CETSA results show that GBP1 interacts with many members of the proteasome. Furthermore, GBP1 inhibition sensitizes OC cells to paclitaxel treatment via accumulated ubiquitinylated proteins where GBP1 inhibition decreases the overall proteasomal activity. In contrast, GBP1-overexpressing cells acquired paclitaxel resistance via boosted cellular proteasomal activity. Overall, these studies expand the role of GBP1 in the activation of proteasomal machinery to acquire chemoresistance. Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

N2  -  Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MPeM) is a rare and highly invasive malignant tumor with a lack of specificity in clinical manifestations, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Due to the difficulty of early diagnosis, most patients are already in the advanced stage when diagnosed, and the prognosis is poor. At present, there is no standard treatment strategy, and the existing treatment methods are not effective, the duration of remission is short, which cannot meet the clinical needs. Here we describe a patient with advanced MPeM, initially misdiagnosed as ovarian cancer, who responded to treatment with bevacizumab in combination with albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin. In preparation for cytoreductive surgery (CRS), MPeM was confirmed by laparoscopic peritoneal nodule biopsy combined with histological and immunohistochemical results. Subsequently, due to intolerable neurotoxicity after chemotherapy, she received oral anlotinib therapy on April 25, 2022, and remained stable disease (SD) with the medication, having achieved more than 14 months of progression-free survival (PFS) as of the date of our manuscript submission. The patient's total treatment time was over 19 months. These treatments delayed tumor progression, reduced drug side effects, maintained a good quality of life, and further extended overall survival (OS). Our experience is that on the one hand, it is necessary to increase the clinician's understanding of the disease, and make full use of tissue samples and immunohistochemical staining to reduce the occurrence of misdiagnosis. On the other hand, based on preliminary evidence, we found that oral anlotinib offers a viable maintenance treatment strategy for patients with advanced mesothelioma, which needs to be further explored in future studies.

N2  -  Cutaneous metastases of ovarian cancer are rare and often have poor prognosis. We report a case of a 62-year-old woman with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian cancer, who presented with lung, brain, and multiple skin (nasal and anterior chest wall) metastases approximately six months after the initial diagnosis. In this case, Nijmegen breakage syndrome carrier status caused by RAD50 heterozygous mutation and previous bevacizumab therapy could be the predisposing factor for cutaneous metastases. The patient was treated with local radiotherapy (nasal skin and brain, 30Gy/6f/1.2W) and three courses of chemotherapy with albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin, resulting in drastic remission of the cutaneous metastases. Unfortunately, treatment interruption resulted in rapid tumor progression, followed by death. This case represents an interesting example of cutaneous metastasis of ovarian cancer with rare clinical manifestations, unique genetic mutations, and reasonable response to treatment. Chemoradiotherapy might be an appropriate option for cutaneous metastases of ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, we still hope to find out the best treatment strategy after collecting and reviewing more cases in the future. Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yingyao, Yan, Qianru, Hong, Chen and Lei.

N2  -  Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a fatal disease with a high mortality rate due to difficulties in early diagnosis and metastasis. Common sites of metastasis from PC include the liver, lung, stomach and kidney. Patients diagnosed at already the metastatic stages on presentation constitute 50-55% of the cases, with a 5-year survival rate of 3%. By contrast, secondary ovarian metastases account for 10-25% of all ovarian malignancies, though an accurate diagnosis remain challenging. The present study reports the rare case of a 42-year-old woman with primary hepatic metastasis and secondary ovarian metastasis from PC treated with two lines of immunotherapy, who is also experiencing severe treatment-associated toxicity. The patient first received combined immunotherapy consisting of camrelizumab (200 mg; day 1; every 3 weeks) and chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2; days 1 and 8; every 3 weeks) and gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2; days 1 and 8; every 3 weeks). She then exhibited a partial response following 4 months of treatment. However, 9 months after the initial treatment, the disease progressed with ovarian involvement, which was confirmed by surgery. Second-line treatment included immunotherapy, targeted therapy and oral chemotherapy (200 mg sintilimab on day 1; 50 mg tegafur from days 1-14, twice daily; and 8 mg anlotinib from days 1-14, every 3 weeks). The progression-free survival time from this second-line treatment was 6 months. Immunotherapy was permanently aborted due to severe intestinal inflammation, where four lines of combined treatments were recommended. The patient remains on treatment with a good quality of life in July 2022, and a current overall survival time of >24 months. In conclusion, the diagnosis of metastatic PC leads to a poor prognosis, but ovarian metastasis from PC is rare. Furthermore, the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy or antiangiogenic inhibitors shows promise as a treatment strategy for advanced stages of PC. Copyright: © Tao et al.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Circular RNA (circRNA) has an essential regulatory role in the chemotherapy resistance of cancers. Nevertheless, the role of circRNA nuclear receptor-interacting protein 1 (circNRIP1) in the paclitaxel (PTX) resistance of ovarian cancer (OC) remains unclear., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The circNRIP1, miR-211-5p and homeobox C8 (HOXC8) expression levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. The PTX resistance of cells was measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2-yl)-2-5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Furthermore, cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were detected by colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. Moreover, the protein levels of proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis-related markers and HOXC8 were determined by Western blot (WB) analysis. Tumor xenograft models were constructed to explore the influence of circNRIP1 on OC tumor growth. The interaction between miR-211-5p and circNRIP1 or HOXC8 was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay., RESULTS: CircNRIP1 was highly expressed in PTX-resistant OC tissues and cells. Silencing of circNRIP1 repressed the PTX resistance of OC cells in vitro and OC tumor in vivo. Furthermore, circNRIP1 sponged miR-211-5p, and miR-211-5p inhibitor could reverse the inhibitory effect of circNRIP1 knockdown on the PTX resistance of OC cells. In addition, miR-211-5p targeted HOXC8, and HOXC8 overexpression could reverse the suppression effect of miR-211-5p on the PTX resistance of OC cells. Additionally, the expression of HOXC8 was regulated by circNRIP1 and miR-211-5p., CONCLUSION: CircNRIP1 silencing could inhibit the PTX resistance of OC via regulating the miR-211-5p/HOXC8 axis, showing that circNRIP1 might be a potential target for OC resistance treatment.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is an anticancer drug first isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree. It has been widely used for the treatment of ovarian, breast, uterine and other cancers because of its low toxicity, high efficiency and broad-spectrum anticancer activity, and it is considered to be one of the most successful natural anticancer drugs available. Paclitaxel is a microtubule-targeting drug whose main molecular mechanism is to disrupt microtubule dynamics and induce mitotic arrest and cell death. Despite the many clinical successes of paclitaxel, the extraction of natural paclitaxel from Taxus species has proven to be environmentally unsustainable and economically unviable. As a result, researchers are constantly working to find innovative ways to meet society's need for this drug. Currently, many methods, including artificial cultivation, microbial fermentation, chemical synthesis, and tissue and cell culture, have been explored and developed to obtain paclitaxel. In addition, the poor water solubility of paclitaxel has led to significant limitations in its clinical application. Conventional paclitaxel formulations use Cremophor EL and ethanol to dissolve paclitaxel, which can lead to serious side effects. In recent decades, a series of new nanotechnology-based paclitaxel dosage forms have been developed, including albumin-bound paclitaxel, polymeric micellar paclitaxel, polymer-paclitaxel couples, and liposome-encapsulated paclitaxel. These nanoformulations can significantly reduce the toxicity of paclitaxel and greatly improve its anti-tumor efficiency. This paper reviews the development of the production, dosage form and combination therapy of paclitaxel in recent years and presents an outlook, with the aim of providing a theoretical basis and reference for further research on the production and application of paclitaxel in the future.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus platinum as first-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer (OC)., METHODS: Patients administered platinum combined with nab-paclitaxel as first-line chemotherapy for epithelial OC, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer from July 2018 to December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Adverse events (AEs) were examined. Subgroup analysis was performed., RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (median age, 54.5 years; range, 20.0-79.0 years) were evaluated, including 12 and 60 administered neoadjuvant therapy and primary surgery with subsequent chemotherapy, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 25.6 months, and the median PFS was 26.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]=24.0-29.3) months in the whole patient population. In the neoadjuvant subgroup, the median PFS was 26.7 (95% CI=22.9-30.5) months vs. 30.1 (95% CI=23.1-37.1) months in the primary surgery subgroup. Twenty-seven patients were administered nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin and had a median PFS of 30.3 (95% CI=not available [NA]-NA) months. The commonest grade 3-4 AEs included anemia (15.3%), white blood cell decreased (11.1%), and neutrophil count decreased (20.8%). No drug-related hypersensitivity reactions occurred., CONCLUSION: Nab-paclitaxel plus platinum as first-line treatment in OC was associated with a favorable prognosis and was tolerable in patients with OC.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer., METHODS: We performed a single institution retrospective review of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were treated with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel from 2012 to 2018 at the Mayo Clinic in Florida., RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified and the median PFS for patients treated with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was 9 months (95% CI, 5.7-20.7). Overall, 17 of the 20 patients (85%) achieved a clinical benefit (complete response 5%, partial response 55%, or stable disease at 3 months 25%). For platinum-sensitive disease and platinum-resistant disease, the median OS were 38.7 months (95% CI, 5.8-63.1) and 31.2 months (95% CI, 12.8-51.8), respectively (p = 0.4306)., CONCLUSION: This well-tolerated regimen shows promising activity in recurrent ovarian cancer and is a viable option for patients who are intolerant to paclitaxel or carboplatin because of allergic reactions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Despite ongoing developments, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult tumors to treat. Even the most effective chemotherapy regimens, only marginally improve the outcome of Pancreatic cancer patients, which rarely exceeds one year. A small subset of Pancreatic cancer patients, carriers of germline variants of BRCA1/2, are clinically relevant as therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer, both for the first-line and maintenance therapy, as they are more responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy agents and PARP inhibitors. Though, a little is known about the efficacy of olaparib monotherapy in later lines, or in poor responders to platinum-based regimens., METHODS: We describe a case of a patient with pancreatic cancer harboring BRCA2 mutation, treated with radical surgery, adjuvant treatment and three different palliative chemotherapy regimens at disease recurrence (FOLFOX in first line with progression-free survival of five months, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in the second line with progression-free survival of six months and FOLFIRI in the third line with progression-free survival of three months) before olaparib off-label treatment., RESULTS: Interestingly, the patient remained 10 months on olaparib treatment, without disease progression, and without any side effects from the treatment., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this case highlights the clinically relevant progression-free survival with olaparib treatment in later line and the potential of better health-related quality of life in this small subset of Pancreatic cancer patients.

N2  -  During a screening performed by the National Cancer Institute in the 1960s, the terpenoid paclitaxel was discovered. Paclitaxel expanded the treatment options for breast, lung, prostate and ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel is only present in minute amounts in the bark of Taxia brevifolia. A sustainable supply was ensured with a culture developed from Taxus chinensis, or with semi-synthesis from other taxanes. Paclitaxel is marketed under the name Taxol. An intermediate from the semi-synthesis docetaxel is also used as a drug and marketed as Taxotere. O-Methylated docetaxel is used for treatment of some paclitaxel-resistant cancer forms as cabazitaxel. The solubility problems of paclitaxel have been overcome by formulation of a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (NAB-paclitaxel, Abraxane). The mechanism of action is affinity towards microtubules, which prevents proliferation and consequently the drug would be expected primarily to be active towards cancer cells proliferating faster than benign cells. The activity against slowly growing tumors such as solid tumors suggests that other effects such as oncogenic signaling or cellular trafficking are involved. In addition to terpenoids, recently discovered microtubule-targeting polyketide macrolides and non-ribosomal peptides have been discovered and marketed as drugs. The revolutionary improvements for treatment of cancer diseases targeting microtubules have led to an intensive search for other compounds with the same target. Several polyketide macrolides, terpenoids and non-ribosomal peptides have been investigated and a few marketed.

N2  -  Chemoresistance is often a cause of the failure of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Sorcin (SRI) is a soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein involved in chemoresistant processes and is overexpressed in many chemoresistant cancer cells, including paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant ovarian cancer. Increased SRI can reduce the concentration of calcium ions in the cytosol and mitochondria and the decrease of calcium ion concentration prevents the occurrence of apoptosis. Here we examined the SRI expression in multiple cancers using a human TissueArray and found that SRI expression was significantly higher in malignant tumor tissues. Furthermore, SRI was overexpressed, while intracellular calcium concentration was decreased, in chemoresistant cancer cells. To restore intracellular calcium homeostasis and overcome chemoresistance, we developed lipid-coated albumin-PTX nanoparticles loaded with SRI-siRNA (LANP-PTX-siSRI) for PTX and SRI-siRNA co-delivery. LANP-PTX-siSRI had dual-target roles in the regulation of SRI and the delivery of PTX into chemoresistant cells. The LANP-PTX-siSRI inhibited the expression of SRI and enhanced intracellular calcium, leading to the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of the growth of PTX-resistant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the mechanism study revealed that the overexpression of SRI was associated with an impaired TGF-beta signaling pathway. The administration of TGF-beta1 inhibited two calcium-binding proteins SRI and S100A14. In conclusion, our data unveil that restoring intracellular calcium ion homeostasis via reducing SRI expression can reverse chemoresistance. Thus, the fabricated LANP-PTX-siSRI has a potentially therapeutical application. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

N2  -  Objective: This study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma., Methods: A total of 84 patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated in our hospital from May 2017 to June 2018 were selected as the research objects. The patients were divided into observation group (n = 42) and control group (n = 42) according to random number table method. The observation group was treated with olaparib combined with bevacizumab, while the control group was treated with albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab, and the clinical efficacy of the two groups was observed. The levels of serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), and epididymal protein 4 (HE4) were determined. The levels of miRNA124, mirNA-21, and miRNA-203 in the two groups were detected. The incidence of adverse reactions was compared between the two groups. The quality of life of the two groups was assessed using FACT-G scale. The drug safety of the two groups was observed. All patients were followed up for 3 years, and the survival time of the two groups was recorded. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the survival of the two groups., Results: The overall response rate (ORR) (69.05%) and disease control rate (DCR) (88.10%) of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (40.48% and 66.67%), and the differences were statistically significant (both P < 0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum CA125, CA199, HE4, miRNA124, miRNA-21, and miRNA-203 and the improvement degree of quality of life score in the observation group were greater than those in the control group, with statistical significances (all P < 0.05). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates of the observation group (97.62%, 88.10%, and 80.95%) were higher than those of the control group (71.43%, 57.14%, and 47.62%), with statistical significances (all P > 0.05)., Conclusion: PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab had good effect in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma and can effectively improve the survival time and quality of life of patients.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of albumin-bound paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (Nab-TC) with that of traditional solvent-based paclitaxel combined with carboplatin (TC) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) regimens for primary epithelial ovarian cancer., METHODS: Eighty patients with advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer admitted for treatment at the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2015 to January 2020 were retrospectively selected. All patients underwent surgery after 1-4 courses of NAC with Nab-TC or TC regimen. Among the patients included for study, 40 patients in each group., RESULTS: The ORR in Nab-TC group was better compared to TC group (45% vs 40%), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.651). While the reduction rate of CA-125 value in the Nab-TC group was significantly better (P < 0.05). The postoperative complication rate such as postoperative blood transfusion (5% vs 35%) and postoperative infusion of human albumin (25% vs 55%) were significantly lower relative to the TC group. The median progression-free survival of the Nab-TC group was significantly longer relative to the TC group (20 months vs 13 months, P = 0.012), and the patient's quality of life was also better in the Nab-TC group (P < 0.05). Our study demonstrated that Nab-TC regimen and R0 represented the independent prognostic factors., CONCLUSION: The efficacy of the Nab-TC regimen as NAC for advanced primary epithelial ovarian cancer was non-inferior to that of the TC regimen along with a lower incidence of adverse reactions, a longer PFS and a higher quality of life, supporting its therapeutic value in the clinic.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is the eminent gynecological malignancy and chemoresistance remains a major reason for poor in ovarian cancer patients. Taxol has been proved as the most effective chemotherapeutic agent against ovarian cancer. However development of Taxol resistance remains a major problem. Here, we report that STAT3, directly activates pentose-phosphate pathway to exert pro-oncogenic effects on Taxol resistance of ovarian cancer. In addition, we found that STAT3, p-STAT3 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) protein levels are upregulated in Taxol resistant cell lines compared with Taxol sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of STAT3 decreased G6PD mRNA expression level and enhanced the sensitivity of Taxol resistant cell to Taxol. Finally, we found that STAT3 directly binds to the G6PD promoter region and promotes the expression of G6PD at transcriptional level. Taken together, our data indicate that activation of STAT3 promotes ovarian cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and Taxol resistance via augmenting G6PD expression and pentose-phosphate metabolism flux, which provides a potential therapeutic target that may improve prognosis by decreasing G6PD expression and enhancing Taxol-sensitivity.

N2  -  More than 90% of ovarian cancer deaths are due to relapse following development of chemoresistance. Our main objective is to better understand the molecular mechanism underlying paclitaxel resistance (taxol resistance, Txr) in ovarian cancer. Here, we observed that the linker histone H1.0 is upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of H1.0 significantly downregulates the androgen receptor (AR) and sensitizes paclitaxel-resistant SKOV3/Txr and 2774/Txr cell lines to paclitaxel. Conversely, ectopic expression of H1.0 upregulates AR and increases Txr in parental SKOV3 and MDAH2774 cells. Notably, H1.0 upregulation is associated with disease recurrence and poor survival in a subset of ovarian cancer subjects. Inhibition of PI3K significantly reduces H1.0 mRNA and protein levels in paclitaxel-resistant cells, suggesting the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of H1.0 and AR also downregulates the Txr genes ABCB1 and ABCG2 in paclitaxel-resistant cells. Our data show that H1.0 induces GCN5 expression and histone acetylation, thereby enhancing Txr gene transactivation. These findings suggest that Txr in ovarian cancer involves the PI3K/AKT pathway and leads to upregulation of histone H1.0, recruitment of GCN5 and AR, followed by upregulation of a subgroup of Txr genes that include ABCB1 and ABCG2. This study is the first report describing the relationship between histone H1.0 and GCN5 that cooperate to induce AR-dependent Txr in ovarian cancer cells. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Chemotherapy resistance remains a major problem in many solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancer. Glucocorticoids are one potential driver of chemotherapy resistance as they can mediate tumor progression via induction of cell-survival pathways. We investigated whether combining the selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulator relacorilant with taxanes can enhance antitumor activity., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The effect of relacorilant on paclitaxel efficacy was assessed in OVCAR5 cells in vitro and in the MIA PaCa-2 xenograft. A phase 1 study of patients with advanced solid tumors was conducted to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel., RESULTS: In OVCAR5 cells, relacorilant reversed the deleterious effects of glucocorticoids on paclitaxel efficacy (P < 0.001). Compared with paclitaxel alone, relacorilant + paclitaxel reduced tumor growth and slowed time to progression in xenograft models (both P < 0.0001). In the heavily pretreated phase 1 population [median (range) of prior regimens: 3 (1-8), prior taxane in 75.3% (55/73)], 33% (19/57) of response-evaluable patients achieved durable disease control (>=16 weeks) with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel and 28.6% (12/42) experienced longer duration of benefit than on prior taxane (up to 6.4x). The most common dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was neutropenia, which was manageable with prophylactic G-CSF. Clinical benefit with relacorilant + nab-paclitaxel was also associated with GR-regulated transcript-level changes in a panel of GR-controlled genes., CONCLUSIONS: The observed preclinical, clinical, and GR-specific pharmacodynamic responses demonstrate that selective GR modulation with relacorilant combined with nab-paclitaxel may promote chemotherapy response and is tolerable. Further evaluation of this combination in tumor types responsive to taxanes is ongoing. Copyright ©2022 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  -  Though the great success of paclitaxel, the variable response of patients to the drug limits its clinical utility and the precise mechanisms underlying the variable response to paclitaxel remain largely unknown. This study aims to verify the role and the underlying mechanisms of CD147 in paclitaxel resistance. Immunostaining was used to analyze human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer tissues. RNA-sequencing was used to identify downstream effectors. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining were used to detect apoptosis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were performed to determine protein interactions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) was performed to measure the speed of microtubule turnover. Xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate sensitivity of cancer cells to paclitaxel in vivo. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that silencing CD147 sensitized the cancer cells to paclitaxel treatment. CD147 protected cancer cells from paclitaxel-induced caspase-3 mediated apoptosis regardless of p53 status. Truncation analysis showed that the intracellular domain of CD147 (CD147ICD) was indispensable for CD147-regulated sensitivity to paclitaxel. Via screening the interacting proteins of CD147ICD, Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) was identified to interact with CD147ICD via its C-terminal tail. Furthermore, we showed that RanBP1 mediated CD147-regulated microtubule stability and dynamics as well as response to paclitaxel treatment. These results demonstrated that CD147 regulated paclitaxel response by interacting with the C-terminal tail of RanBP1 and targeting CD147 may be a promising strategy for preventing paclitaxel resistant.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Optimal first-line chemotherapy regimens are crucial for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) treatment. Nab-paclitaxel has showed its considerable survival and low toxicity profiles in first-line treatment for three solid tumors and is recommended as a treatment for recurrent EOC. We focus on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of nab-paclitaxel in current clinical studies of EOC treatment and aim to explore the potential feasibility of nab-paclitaxel as the first-line treatment for EOC., METHODS: We searched for eligible studies up to January 2020 in Pubmed. Outcomes of interests included drug regimes, objective response rate (ORR), median progression free survival (PFS), median overall survival (OS) and main adverse events to determine feasibility of nab-paclitaxel., RESULTS: This review included nine eligible studies. One study about nab-paclitaxel with carboplatin as first-line therapy in ten cases after hypersensitivity to paclitaxel had an ORR of 100%, median PFS of 16.7 months and median OS of 65.4 months. Evidence of nab-paclitaxel activity in platinum-sensitive EOC demonstrated an ORR of 64%, a median time to response of 1.3 months and PFS of 8.5 months. The ORR, median PFS and median OS range in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant EOC from 23%-72%, 4.0-8.5 months, 16.8-17.4 months, respectively. All studies demonstrated manageable toxicity profile in EOC patients., CONCLUSION: Nab-paclitaxel presents potentials as the first-line chemotherapy for considerable survival and safety in EOC compared to conventional paclitaxel. However, there is no prospective trial in EOC so far. Therefore, more studies about nab-paclitaxel are needed. Copyright © 2022.

N2  -  TumorSelect R is an anticancer technology that combines cytotoxics, nanotechnology, and knowledge of human physiology to develop innovative therapeutic interventions with minimal undesirable side effects commonly observed in conventional chemotherapy. Tumors have a voracious appetite for cholesterol which facilitates tumor growth and fuels their proliferation. We have transformed this need into a stealth delivery system to disguise and deliver anticancer drugs with the assistance of both the human body and the tumor cell. Several designer prodrugs are incorporated within pseudo-LDL nanoparticles, which carry them to tumor tissues, are taken up, internalized, transformed into active drugs, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Highly lipophilic prodrug conjugates of paclitaxel suitable for incorporation into the pseudo-LDL nanoparticles of the TumorSelect R delivery vehicle formulation were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in the panel of 24-h NCI-60 human tumor cell line screening to demonstrate the power of such an innovative approach. Taxane prodrugs, viz., ART-207 was synthesized by tethering paclitaxel to lipid moiety with the aid of a racemic solketal as a linker in cost-effective, simple, and straightforward synthetic transformations. In addition to the typical 24-h NCI screening protocol, these compounds were assessed for growth inhibition or killing of ovarian cell lines for 48 and 72h-time intervals and identified the long-lasting effectiveness of these lipophilic prodrugs. All possible, enantiomerically pure isomers of ART-207 were also synthesized, and cytotoxicities were biosimilar to racemic ART-207, suggesting that enantiopurity of linker has a negligible effect on cell proliferation. To substantiate further, ART-207 was evaluated for its in vivo tumor reduction efficacy by studying the xenograft model of ovarian cancer grown in SCID mice. Reduced weight loss (a measure of toxicity) in the ART-207 group was observed, even though it was dosed at 2.5x the paclitaxel equivalent of Abraxane R. As a result, our delineated approach is anticipated to improve patient quality of life, patient retention in treatment regimes, post-treatment rapid recovery, and overall patient compliance without compromising the efficacy of the cytotoxic promiscuous natural products.

N2  -  Mutation of BRCA2, a breast cancer susceptibility gene, is associated with the development of breast and ovarian cancer. Olaparib is an oral poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which has been proven to treat BRCA-mutated tumors effectively, especially breast and ovarian cancer. Here, we report a case of a germline BRCA2-mutated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, responded well to olaparib. A 41-year-old man with no history of smoking was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with bevacizumab, pemetrexed disodium, and cis-platinum in the first-line therapy of 6 months, followed by bevacizumab, Abraxane, and sintilimab treatments for another 6 months. As disease progression was confirmed and the presence of germline BRCA2 mutation, the combinational treatment of olaparib/anlotinib was applied to achieve partial response 1 month later, and the progression-free survival was extended for another 5 months. This study shows metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with BRCA2 mutation could also respond well to PARP inhibitor, broadening the spectrum of BRCA-mutated cancers suitable for olaparib therapy. With acquired resistance to chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and immunotherapy, the patient still gained significant benefits from the targeted therapy. Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

N2  -  Basophils are involved in manifestations of hypersensitivity, however, the current understanding of their propensity for activation and their prognostic value in cancer patients remains unclear. As in healthy and atopic individuals, basophil populations were identified in blood from ovarian cancer patients (n = 53) with diverse tumor histologies and treatment histories. Ex vivo basophil activation was measured by CD63 expression using the basophil activation test (BAT). Irrespective of prior treatment, basophils could be activated by stimulation with IgE- (anti-FcepsilonRI and anti-IgE) and non-IgE (fMLP) mediated triggers. Basophil activation was detected by ex vivo exposure to paclitaxel, but not to other anti-cancer therapies, in agreement with a clinical history of systemic hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel. Protein and gene expression analyses support the presence of basophils (CCR3, CD123, FcepsilonRI) and activated basophils (CD63, CD203c, tryptase) in ovarian tumors. Greater numbers of circulating basophils, cells with greater capacity for ex vivo stimulation (n = 35), and gene signatures indicating the presence of activated basophils in tumors (n = 439) were each associated with improved survival in ovarian cancer. Circulating basophils in cancer patients respond to IgE- and non-IgE-mediated signals and could help identify hypersensitivity to therapeutic agents. Activated circulating and tumor-infiltrating basophils may be potential biomarkers in oncology.

N2  -  One of the major challenges related to solvent-based taxanes administration in clinical practice is the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free, albumin-bound, paclitaxel, which minimize the risk of HSR occurrence. In this single-institution, retrospective analysis, we evaluated stage IIIc-IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, treated with first-line carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (+/- bevacizumab), after the occurrence of an HSR with solvent-based paclitaxel (and/or docetaxel). Between April 2012 and December 2018, ten patients (20.8%) received carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel (+/- bevacizumab) after the occurrence of an HSR to solvent-based taxanes. Among the evaluable patients, ORR was 100%. At median follow-up of 28.5 months, median PFS was 16.7 months, and median OS was 65.4 months, respectively. Median received dose intensity (DI) was 86% and 80% of the projected DI for nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin, respectively. There were no treatment-related grade 4 adverse events. Most relevant treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were: asthenia (10%), hypertransaminasemia (10%), neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and anemia (10%). No HSR recurrence was observed. The high rate of HSR occurrence could limit first-line treatment options in clinical practice. Carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel association could represent a valid treatment option in this setting.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To assess the anti-tumor activity and side effects of different dosages of paclitaxel (albumin binding type) (hereinafter referred to as nab-P) combined with Apatinib (hereinafter referred to as AP) in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell line and xenograft models., METHODS: SKOV-3/DDP cell line was selected as the research object in cytology experiment. Firstly, we divided it into three groups for experiments to explore the individual effects of nab-P and AP. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): nab-P group, nab-P 40 mumol/l; c): AP group, AP 50 mumol/l (Drug doses were IC-50 values that detected by MTT assay). Apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl-2), vascular related protein(p-VEGFR-2), invasion related protein (MMP-2) expression were detected by Western blot and Cellular immunofluorescence, the invasion ability of tumor cells were detected by Transwell and Cell scratch test. Based on these dates, secondly, establishing different doses of nab-P combined with Ap to explore the curative effect of combination therapy. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): Group-1, nab-P 5 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, c): Group-2, nab-P 4.5 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, d): Group-3, nab-P 4 mumol/l + AP 10 mumol/l, e): nab-P group, nab-P 5 mumol/l, f): AP group, AP 10 mumol/l (MTT assay). The combination index was analyzed by Compusyn software, Western blot, Immunofluescence, Transwell and Cell scratch test also were also chose to observe of inhibition effect. Thirdly, we used xenograft models to verify the results of cytological experiments. Tumor-forming BALB/c female nude mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, a): Control group, no drug intervention, only saline injection, b): nab-P 20 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg, c): nab-P 18 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg, d): nab-P 16 mg/kg + AP 150 mg/kg (The doses were guided by the pharmaceutical manufacturers). The tumor growth curve was analyzed during the experiment. And the apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl-2), angiogenesis related protein (CD31, p-VEGFR-2) and invasion related protein (MMP-2) were observed by Western blot, Immunofluescence and Immunohistochemistry to analysis the ant-tumor effects. The quality of life in nude mice were observed to analysed the drug-induced side effects., RESULT: In the separate medication section, (1) The IC-50 value of nab-P was 45.53 +/- 4.06 mumol/l, while the AP was 50.66 +/- 4.96 umol/L (48 h). (2) The expressions of bcl-2 (nab-P group, AP group), p-VEGFR-2 (AP group), MMP-2(nab-P group, AP group) were higher than Control group, while Bax (nab-P group, AP group) lower (P < 0.01). (3) The cell invasive ability was decreased after the nab-P and AP intervation (P < 0.01). In the combination medication section, (1) Compusyn showed the Combination index (Cl) were all below 1 (Cl < 1), that means nab-P and AP are synergism. (2) The combination IC-50 value was nab-P 5.28 mumol/l + AP 10.56 mumol/l (48 h). (3) In the detection of related protein expression, the combination of drugs can improve the anti-tumor effect, otherwise, after combined with AP, when nab-P were reduced dose in proper quantity, there were no obvious different in drug effect. (4) After reducing the doses of nab-P, the average food intake of nude mice increased from 4.50 g +/- 0.17 to 5.55 g +/- 0.13, and the one-hour activity increased from 6.11 min +/-0.16 to 6.34 min +/-0.13., CONCLUSION: nab-P, a chemotherapeutic agent, can play an anti-tumor role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, but it can cause adverse effects that increase with dose. When combined with AP, the two drugs have synergistic effect, which can improve the anti-tumor effects of single drug. In addition, when combined with AP, the doses of nab-P can be appropriately reduced under the standard of recommended to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs, without affecting the anti-tumor effect.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer is associated with a dismal prognosis, with ductal adenocarcinoma being the most common form of primary neoplasm diagnosed. Clear cell carcinoma is usually associated with kidney, ovarian or bladder malignancy but rarely associated with pancreatic malignancy. According to the WHO classification, primary clear cell adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is a rare "miscellaneous" carcinoma, and to date few cases have been reported in the literature., CASE: A 63-year old female who presented to a metropolitan hospital in Australia with abdominal pain suggestive of pancreatitis. Abdominal computed tomography subsequently demonstrated a necrotic mass in the neck of the pancreas with hepatic metastasis. Subsequent histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis was consistent with pancreatic clear cell adenocarcinoma. The patient was discharged to home to commence on dose reduced nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine., CONCLUSION: This case reports a rare variant of pancreatic malignancy and contributes further evidence to the body of literature highlighting clear cell adenocarcinoma as a histological subtype of pancreatic neoplasm, albeit rare in nature.

N2  -  Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and chemotherapy, as its main treatment, has side effects in clinical application due to lack of targeting selectivity to tumor tissues. Theranostic nanomaterials have shown wonderful functions for the diagnosis and therapy of disease benefitting from the controllability of nanomaterials. However, there is still little available for clinical transformation due to the uncertain biocompatibility. It is urgent to develop nanoprobes possessing bright transformation potentials. This study reports a facile biomineralization route to synthesize the theranostic nanoprobe using the clinic available nano-drug (trademark Abraxane). Further profiting from the binding ability of albumin to metal cations, we successfully prepared biocompatible nanoprobe, BSA-Gd2O3/PTX@Anti-HE4 mAb, for the targeted magnetic resonance imaging and chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma. The obtained nanoprobe has the advantages of uniform particle size, good dispersibility and favorable stability. In vivo and in vitro experiment results showed that the nanoprobe can realize targeted magnetic resonance imaging and chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma. Such a novel multifunctional nanoprobe based on clinic nano-drug might be promising for clinic transformation. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is one of the most malignant tumors of the female reproductive system, with high invasiveness. The disease is a severe threat to women's health. The ITGA2 gene, which codes for integrin subunit alpha2, is involved in the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells. Although previous studies have shown that ITGA2 increases in ovarian cancer, the specific molecular mechanism of how ITGA2 promotes ovarian cancer proliferation and metastasis is still unclear. In this study, we confirmed that ITGA2 was elevated in ovarian cancer, which led to poor prognosis and survival. Overexpressed ITGA2 promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. We also found that ITGA2 regulated the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) by mediating AKT phosphorylation, which provided a reasonable explanation for ITGA2's role in ovarian cancer's resistance to albumin paclitaxel. In summary, ITGA2 could be used as a new therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  The US and governments around the world, and companies, have made a considerable investment in nanomedicine, and there have been important discoveries. Nevertheless, there has been considerable debate as to whether the investment, both in money and in time, has been worth it. That question is not yet definitively answerable. However, investigators (and investors) might also wonder if the efforts in nanomedicine are likely to continue at the same pace as over the past decade. For this paper, an analysis was done by searching Medline, RePORT, the DOD (CDMRP), the NSF, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The major findings from the analysis are as follows: (1) The number of journal articles on the subject of nanomedicine continues to steadily rise and the areas "Drug Carriers" and "Drug Delivery Systems" are experiencing particularly rapid growth. (2) The level of funding from the Department of Health and Human Services (NIH and others) for indications other than cancer has been greater than that for cancer. (3) Funding for applications in HIV/AIDS has been strong. (4) Most of the cancers are being impacted. (5) The number of clinical trials are more highly focused in breast, skin, metastatic, and ovarian cancers, though the noncancer indications of pain and infections are also highly represented. The trials are primarily in Phases I and II, suggesting a long horizon before translating to a high impact on patients. (6) The vast majority of the clinical trials are for the evaluation of established nanomedicine formulations (liposomes and nab-paclitaxel/Abraxane) in combination with other therapies. Nevertheless, the number of clinical trials with other nanomedicine formulations has been increasing since 2009. Relatively few of the trials are for micelles or dendrimers. Taken as a whole, the analysis provides a picture that nanomedicine continues to be highly funded and highly studied but with few recent breakthroughs. Nanomedicine has yet to provide the "silver bullet" for therapy in cancer or other diseases, and it remains unclear whether it ever will.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Family history of BRCA-related tumors may correlate with response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) in pancreatic cancer. The frequency of germline mutations has been reported in patients predominantly under the age of 60 or with strong family history. We examine the incidence of deleterious germline mutations and compare the chemotherapy responses and OS in an unselected group of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, who were seen at a single cancer center between 2010 and 2016, were included. Germline DNA was sequenced using a 263-gene panel to identify novel mutations (N = 133 MD Anderson cohort, N = 127 TCGA cohort). Chemotherapy response and OS were determined by review of medical records., RESULTS: Deleterious germline mutations were identified in 26 of 133 patients (19.5%). Patients with DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations (ATM, BRCA1/2, CDKN2A, CHEK2, ERCC4, PALB2, n = 15) had an improved OS as compared with patients without (16.8 vs. 9.1 months, P = 0.03). Conversely, patients with other deleterious mutations had a trend toward worse OS. However, survival in the latter group was longer (P = NS) in those mutants initially treated with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. A family history of multiple breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers was associated with DDR gene mutations and better survival., CONCLUSIONS: We have identified novel germline mutations that are prognostic for survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. We observe improved survival in patients with DDR gene mutations and worsened survival in patients with deleterious mutations in non-DDR genes.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BEV) combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP) in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer., METHODS: Eighty-six patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer admitted to our hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups, namely, BEV + ABP group (n=43, treated with BEV combined with ABP) and ABP group (n=43, treated with ABP alone). Next, the clinical objective response rate (ORR), changes in serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) level and adverse reactions were compared between two groups. Additionally, the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed and recorded after treatment., RESULTS: The clinical ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 86.0% (37/43) and 93.0% (40/43) in BEV + ABP group and 62.8% (27/43) and 79.1% (34/43) in ABP group, respectively. The clinical ORR of patients exhibited a statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.025), which was overtly higher in BEV + ABP group than that in ABP group, while the DCR had no statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.117). The serum CA125 level was evidently decreased in both groups after treatment (p<0.05) compared with that before treatment, but it displayed no statistically significant difference between two groups after treatment (p=0.220). The major adverse reactions of patients were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reaction, alopecia, rash, fatigue and peripheral neurotoxicity. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse reactions between two groups (p>0.05). All patients were followed up for 6-29 months. The median OS of patients was 16.3 months and 12.6 months in BEV + ABP group and ABP group, respectively, which was clearly longer in BEV + ABP group than that in ABP group (p=0.007). The median PFS in BEV + ABP group was obviously longer than that in ABP group (8.9 months vs. 6.7 months, p=0.028)., CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with ABP alone, BEV combined with ABP applied in the treatment of platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer prominently improves the clinical efficacy, PFS and OS, with good tolerance of patients, which is worthy of popularization and application in clinical practice.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate the role and mechanism of the regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) in paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Methods: (1) The detection of NF-kappaB expression: parental (A2780) and paclitaxel-resistant (A2780/Taxol) ovarian carcinoma cells were divided into four groups, named A2780 group, A2780+cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197, HB-EGF inhibitor) group, A2780/Taxol group and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group. Among four groups, the expression level HB-EGF and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were examined by immunofluorescence double staining on confocal microscopy. Western blot was used to detect the expression level of NF-kappaB. In vivo, A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells were injected intraperitoneally to nude mouse to determine the expression level of NF-kappaB of the tumors from these four groups by immunohistochemistry method. (2) The detection on the function of NF-kappaB: A2780/Taxol cells were divided into four groups, named transfected with empty vector+saline group, NF-kappaB small interference RNA (siRNA)+saline group, empty vector+CRM197 group and NF-kappaB siRNA+CRM197 group respectively. Among four groups, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel, the expression level of plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-gp) and the effect of intracellular rhodomine123 (Rh123) accumulation were detected. Results: (1) The detection of NF-kappaB expression: the expression scores of HB-EGF protein among four groups were 5.6+/-1.3, 2.1+/-1.2, 11.7+/-3.5 and 6.2+/-1.4; the expression scores of EGFR protein were 5.1+/-1.6, 2.8+/-0.6, 10.4+/-3.1 and 5.6+/-1.9, respectively. The expression levels of NF-kappaB protein in the cells of the group named A2780, A2780+CRM197, A2780/Taxol and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group were 1.89+/-0.23, 0.74+/-0.12, 3.45+/-0.16 and 1.31+/-0.08, respectively; the expression scores of NF-kappaB protein in the tissue tumors from four groups were 3.3+/-1.1, 1.4+/-0.4, 8.7+/-2.3 and 3.6+/-1.2, respectively. The expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-kappaB protein between A2780 and A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro were higher than these in A2780+CRM197 and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group, while the expression level of HB-EGF, EGFR and NF-kappaB protein in A2780 group were lower than those in A2780/Taxol groups in vivo and in vitro (P<0.05). (2) The examination of NF-kappaB function: the IC(50) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel in groups transfected with empty vector+saline, NF-kappaB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-kappaB siRNA+CRM197 group were respectively (39.4+/-0.8), (7.6+/-0.6), (6.7+/-0.5) and (4.2+/-0.4) mumol/L, while the expression levels of P-gp protein among four groups were respectively 3.11+/-0.23,1.45+/-0.16, 1.73+/-0.21 and 0.68+/-0.14, the cellular Rh123 accumulation among four groups were respectively 110+/-15, 246+/-19, 231+/-22 and 296+/-24. The expression levels of IC(50) and P-gp protein in groups transfected with NF-kappaB siRNA+saline, empty vector+CRM197 and NF-kappaB siRNA+CRM197 group were significantly higher than those in group transfected with empty vector+saline group (P<0.01), while the cellular Rh123 accumulation among three groups were significantly lower than that in group transfected with empty vector+saline (P<0.01). Conclusions: The expression of NF-kappaB may contributes to the paclitaxel resistance to ovarian cancer. HB-EGF may induce the paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer by the regulation of EGFR/NF-kappaB/P-gp pathway.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is commonly diagnosed only after it has metastasized to the abdominal cavity (stage III). While the current standard of care of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of cisplatin and paclitaxel (PTX) combination chemotherapy has benefit, patient 5-year survival rates are low and have not significantly improved in the past decade. The ability to target chemotherapy selectively to ovarian tumors while sparing normal tissue would improve efficacy and decrease toxicities. We have previously shown that cisplatin-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) loaded within neural stem cells (NSCs) are selectively delivered to ovarian tumors in the abdominal cavity following IP injection, with no evidence of localization to normal tissue. Here we extended the capabilities of this system to also include PTX delivery. NPs that will be loaded into NSCs must contain a high amount of drug by weight but constrain the release of the drug such that the NSCs are viable after loading and can successfully migrate to tumors. We developed silica coated PTX nanocrystals (Si[PTX-NC]) meeting these requirements. Si[PTX-NC] were more effective than uncoated PTX-NC or Abraxane for loading NSCs with PTX. NSCs loaded with Si[PTX-NC] maintained their migratory ability and, for low dose PTX, were more effective than free PTX-NC or Si[PTX-NC] at killing ovarian tumors in vivo. This work demonstrates that NSC/NP delivery is a platform technology amenable to delivering different therapeutics and enables the pursuit of NSC/NP targeted delivery of the entire preferred chemotherapy regimen for ovarian cancer. It also describes efficient silica coating chemistry for PTX nanocrystals that may have applications beyond our focus on NSC transport.

N2  -  Nineteen topics were selected as major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology in 2018. For cervical cancer, the importance of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing alone as primary cervical cancer screening method and negative survival impact of minimally invasive surgery in early-stage cervical cancer were addressed. For ovarian cancer, cost-effectiveness of genetic testing to prevent cancer, use of analgesics and oral pill to reduce cancer risk, efficacy of secondary cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, update in the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and efficacy of anti-angiogenic targeted treatments, including bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were reviewed. For corpus cancer, sentinel lymph node mapping technique, adjuvant therapy in high-risk endometrial cancer (PORTEC-3), and targeted therapy in recurrent disease were covered. For the field of radiation oncology, survival outcomes of chemoradiation compared with chemotherapy alone in metastatic cervical cancer and new findings regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer were introduced. Lastly, for breast cancer, the use of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutation, ovarian suppression for premenopausal patients, adjuvant chemotherapy guided by 21-gene assay, and combination therapy of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel for triple-negative cancer as well as promising overall survival results of palbociclib and fulvestrant in advanced breast cancer were briefly mentioned.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To evaluate intraperitoneal (IP) nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies that are primarily confined to the peritoneal cavity in a phase I trial., METHODS: Using a 3 + 3 dose escalation of IP nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, we evaluated six dose levels (35-175 mg/m2/dose). Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of IP nab-paclitaxel were determined., RESULTS: There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in cohorts 1-3. There was a DLT in one of six patients in cohort 4 (112.5 mg/m2) (grade 3 neutropenia causing treatment delay > 15 days) and a DLT in one of three patients in cohort 6 (175 mg/m2) (grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 abdominal pain). A second patient in cohort 6 experienced a serious adverse event (cycle 1, grade 4 ANC <= 7 days, cycle 4, grade 2 left ventricular dysfunction). This dose level was determined to be above the MTD. No DLTs were seen in seven patients treated in cohort 5 (140 mg/m2). The MTD of IP nab-paclitaxel was established at 140 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. There was a PK advantage for IP nab-paclitaxel, with an IP plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratio of 147-fold (range 50-403) and therapeutic range systemic drug levels. Eight of 27 enrolled patients had progression-free survival >= 6 months. One patient experienced complete response, and one patient experienced partial response. Six patients had stable disease., CONCLUSIONS: Weekly IP nab-paclitaxel has a favorable toxicity profile, a significant pharmacologic advantage, and promising clinical activity., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00825201.

N2  -  Surgery and chemotherapy are the gold-standard treatments for ovarian cancer. The major cause of treatment failure in patients with ovarian cancer is tumoral heterogeneity and drug resistance. Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most commonly used first-line drugs for ovarian cancer chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of post-translational neddylation on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) to PTX-induced apoptosis. Disruption of protein neddylation with the first-in-class inhibitor MLN4924 dramatically neutralized PTX-mediated antiproliferative, antimigration, and apoptotic effects in human OCCs. Moreover, MLN4924 treatment interrupted PTX-induced microtubule polymerization. Importantly, two neddylation conjugating E2 enzymes, UBE2M and UBE2F, were found to play essential roles in PTX-induced cytotoxicity and tubulin polymerization in OCCs. In summary, our findings demonstrated that disruption of protein neddylation by MLN4924 conferred resistance to PTX and provided insights into the potential mechanisms of PTX chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  UNC-45A, a highly conserved member of the UCS (UNC45A/CRO1/SHE4P) protein family of cochaperones, plays an important role in regulating cytoskeletal-associated functions in invertebrates and mammalian cells, including cytokinesis, exocytosis, cell motility, and neuronal development. Here, for the first time, UNC-45A is demonstrated to function as a mitotic spindle-associated protein that destabilizes microtubules (MT) activity. Using in vitro biophysical reconstitution and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy analysis, we reveal that UNC-45A directly binds to taxol-stabilized MTs in the absence of any additional cellular cofactors or other MT-associated proteins and acts as an ATP-independent MT destabilizer. In cells, UNC-45A binds to and destabilizes mitotic spindles, and its depletion causes severe defects in chromosome congression and segregation. UNC-45A is overexpressed in human clinical specimens from chemoresistant ovarian cancer and that UNC-45A-overexpressing cells resist chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy when treated with clinically relevant concentrations of paclitaxel. Lastly, UNC-45A depletion exacerbates paclitaxel-mediated stabilizing effects on mitotic spindles and restores sensitivity to paclitaxel. IMPLICATIONS: These findings reveal novel and significant roles for UNC-45A in regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, broadening our understanding of the basic mechanisms regulating MT stability and human cancer susceptibility to paclitaxel, one of the most widely used chemotherapy agents for the treatment of human cancers.

N2  -  We report here that the androgen receptor (AR) and ABCB1 are upregulated in a model of acquired taxol resistance (txr) in ovarian carcinoma cells. AR silencing sensitizes txr cells to taxol threefold, whereas ectopic AR expression in AR-null HEK293 cells induces resistance to taxol by 1.7-fold. AR activation using the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or sublethal taxol treatment upregulates ABCB1 expression in both txr cells and AR-expressing HEK293 cells. In contrast, AR inactivation using the antagonist bicalutamide downregulates ABCB1 expression and enhances cytotoxicity to taxol. A functional ABCB1 promoter containing five predicted androgen-response elements (AREs) is cloned. Deletion assays reveal a taxol-responsive promoter segment which harbors ARE4. Notably, DHT- or taxol-activated AR potentiates binding of the AR to ARE4 as revealed by the chromatin immunoprecipitation. On the other hand, txr cells display an increase in chromatin remodeling. AR/H3K9ac and AR/H3K14ac complexes bind specifically to ARE4 in response to taxol. Furthermore, acetyltransferase protein levels (p300 and GCN5) are upregulated in txr cells. Silencing of p300 or GCN5 reduces chromatin modification and enhances cytotoxicity in both parental and txr SKOV3 cells. While the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway is significantly activated by taxol, taxol-induced ABCB1 expression, histone posttranslational modifications, and p300 binding to ARE4 are suppressed following inhibition of the PI3K/AKT cellular pathway. These results demonstrate that the AKT/p300/AR axis can be activated to target ABCB1 gene expression in response to taxol, thus revealing a new treatment target to counter taxol resistance.

N2  -  RATIONALE: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is considered as one of the deadliest cancers all over the world. Germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations have been widely studied in breast and ovarian carcinomas as they have been found to enhance the risk for disease progression. Olaparib, an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment strategy of ovarian cancer with any BRCA1/2 mutations. There is a lack of studies which focus on the treatment of other cancer with BRCA-Mutation., PATIENT CONCERNS: This report describes a patient whose presenting complaints were "Physical examination showed that the pancreas was occupied for one month." He initially was diagnosed with stage IV PC based on conventional imaging and pathologic assessment. He had a known germline BRCA 2 mutation, which exhibited a good response to PARP inhibitor therapy., DIAGNOSIS: Through the biopsy histopathological examination, imaging examination, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed as metastatic PC with BRCA2 mutation., INTERVENTIONS: He received gemcitabine and albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy from March 15, 2017 to June 30, 2017, and Nivolumab immunotherapy as the maintenance therapy. After serum CA-199 level increased, Olaparib was orally administered from August 17, 2017 to March. After tumor relapsed, he received multiple lines of chemotherapy, including Trametinib Oxaliplatin, S-1, bevacizumab, and irinotecan liposome injection till July 17, 2018., OUTCOMES: We observed the patient had a good progression-free survival (7.4 months); the lesion of the pancreas was classified as partial disease through Olaparib treatment, which indicated significant shrinkage. But it is difficult to conclude whether such therapy could help prolong the overall survival for such patients., LESSONS: The targeted therapy Olaparib showed early signs of potential in treating PC in patients with mutations of the BRCA genes. With emerging therapeutic modalities and next-generation sequencing development, it is increasingly relevant to consider mutation screenings of patients with PC.

N2  -  High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is often sensitive to initial treatment with platinum and taxane combination chemotherapy, but most patients relapse with chemotherapy-resistant disease. To systematically identify genes modulating chemotherapy response, we performed pooled functional genomic screens in HGSOC cell lines treated with cisplatin, paclitaxel, or cisplatin plus paclitaxel. Genes in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis were among the top candidate resistance genes in both gain-of-function and loss-of-function screens. In an open reading frame overexpression screen, followed by a mini-pool secondary screen, anti-apoptotic genes including BCL2L1 (BCL-XL) and BCL2L2 (BCL-W) were associated with chemotherapy resistance. In a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, loss of BCL2L1 decreased cell survival whereas loss of proapoptotic genes promoted resistance. To dissect the role of individual anti-apoptotic proteins in HGSOC chemotherapy response, we evaluated overexpression or inhibition of BCL-2, BCL-XL, BCL-W, and MCL1 in HGSOC cell lines. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins decreased apoptosis and modestly increased cell viability upon cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment. Conversely, specific inhibitors of BCL-XL, MCL1, or BCL-XL/BCL-2, but not BCL-2 alone, enhanced cell death when combined with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Anti-apoptotic protein inhibitors also sensitized HGSOC cells to the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib. These unbiased screens highlight anti-apoptotic proteins as mediators of chemotherapy resistance in HGSOC, and support inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL1, alone or combined with chemotherapy or targeted agents, in treatment of primary and recurrent HGSOC. IMPLICATIONS: Anti-apoptotic proteins modulate drug resistance in ovarian cancer, and inhibitors of BCL-XL or MCL1 promote cell death in combination with chemotherapy.

N2  -  The major cause of ovarian cancer treatment failure in cancer patients is inherent or acquired during treatment drug resistance of cancer. Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a secreted, non-collagenous extracellular matrix protein involved in inhibition of tissue calcification. Recently, MGP expression was related to cellular differentiation and tumor progression. A detailed MGP expression analysis in sensitive (A2780) and resistant to paclitaxel (PAC) (A2780PR) and topotecan (TOP) (A2780TR) ovarian cancer cell lines and their corresponding media was performed. MGP mRNA level (real time PCR analysis) and protein expression in cell lysates and cell culture medium (Western blot analysis) and protein expression in cancer cells (immunofluorescence analysis) and cancer patient lesions (immunohistochemistry) were determined in this study. We observed increased expression of MGP in PAC and TOP resistant cell lines at both mRNA and protein level. MGP protein was also detected in the corresponding culture media. Finally, we detected expression of MGP protein in ovarian cancer lesions from different histological type of cancer. MGP is an important factor that might contribute to cancer resistance mechanism by augmenting the interaction of cells with ECM components leading to increased resistance of ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel and topotecan. Expression found in ovarian cancer tissue suggests its possible role in ovarian cancer pathogenesis.

N2  -  Present research work is carried out to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions between combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab and single medication of trastuzumab in treatment of ovarian cancer. A total of 80 recurrent ovarian cancer patients in Stage III B or IV confirmed by histopathological examination and/or cytological examination were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups, i.e. the combined medication group (n=37) and the single medication group (n=43). Patients in two groups underwent therapy for 4 cycles to evaluate the short-term efficacy and adverse reactions of these two methods. The control rates of the combined medication group and the single medication group were 86.4% and 81.4%, respectively, while the partial response rates were 45.9% and 44.2%, respectively. As for the overall survival (OS), the OS in the single medication group was 7.0 months, while that in the combined medication group was 7.3 months (p=0.63). Incidence of neutropenia in the single and combined medication groups were respectively 51.2% and 40.5%, while the incidence rates of leukopenia in Stage III or IV were 44.2% and 24.3%, respectively (p<0.001) and the differences between two groups were statistically significant. Also, comparison of the incidence rates of thrombocytopenia between the single (53.5%) and combined (23.6%) medication groups showed statistical significance. With promising efficacy, few adverse reaction and high safety, combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab is more applicable to the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Poor loading capacity and nonspecific tumor accumulation of current drug delivery system remain the critical challenges that prevent nanomedicine from maximizing therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment. Herein, poly(ester amide) polymers composed of cationic and hydrophobic segments were formulated with a paclitaxel/human serum albumin (PTX/HSA) complex, as well as free PTX, to construct a core-shell nanoparticle (NP) platform with the interior simultaneously reserving PTX and PTX/HSA complex, while the exterior absorbing the PTX/HSA complex. Following systematic screening, the optimized NPs, namely, APP1i@e NPs, exhibited small particle size (43.95 nm), maximal PTX loading (42.23%), excellent dynamic stability (at least 1 week), and acid-triggered release. In vitro results showed that after being trafficked through caveolae-mediated endocytosis, APP1i@e NPs successfully escaped from endo-/lysosomes and then rapidly released cargos in the acidic cytosol, which continued to enhance cytotoxicity by mitochondrial control of apoptosis and suppression of microtubule dynamics. Longer circulation time and superior targeting efficiency post-intravenous injection confirmed that surface PEGylation imparted APP1i@e NPs with the ability to control their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The biomimetic shell design with HSA, which enlarged PTX stock and improved biosafety, made APP1i@e NPs more suitable for in vivo applications. Furthermore, in vivo safety and efficacy demonstrated that APP1i@e NPs effectively inhibited the growth of ovarian xenograft tumors, whereas significantly avoiding toxic issues associated with PTX. APP1i@e NPs with surface PEG coating and biomimetic HSA design, therefore, may provide a remarkable improvement in the therapeutic index of taxanes used in the clinic.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Paclitaxel, a microtubule inhibitor, is subject to tumor resistance while treating high-grade serous ovarian and uterine cancer. This study aims to directly compare the effects of SQ1274, a novel microtubule inhibitor that binds to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin, and paclitaxel in high-grade serous ovarian and uterine cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo., METHODS: We assessed the sensitivity of ovarian (OVCAR8) and uterine (ARK1) cancer cell lines to SQ1274 and paclitaxel using XTT assays. We used western blot and quantitative real-time PCR to analyze changes in AXL RNA and protein expression by SQ1274 and paclitaxel. Differences in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis were investigated using flow cytometry. Finally, we treated ovarian and uterine xenograft models with vehicle, paclitaxel, or SQ1274., RESULTS: First, we demonstrate that SQ1274 has a much lower IC50 than paclitaxel in both ARK1 (1.26nM vs. 15.34nM, respectively) and OVCAR8 (1.34nM vs. 10.29nM, respectively) cancer cell lines. Second, we show SQ1274 decreases both RNA and protein expression of AXL. Third, we show that SQ1274 causes increased cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis compared to paclitaxel. Finally, we report that SQ1274 more effectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo compared to paclitaxel., CONCLUSIONS: SQ1274 presents as a viable alternative to paclitaxel for treating ovarian and uterine cancer. This study supports the development of SQ1274 as a chemotherapeutic to treat ovarian and uterine cancer. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To research the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein gene (XIAP) on paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer., METHODS: A2780 and A2780/T cells were treated with paclitaxel respectively at the concentrations of 5 ng/mL,10 ng/mL,20 ng/mL , 40 ng/mL,80 ng/mL,160 ng/mL,320 ng/mL,then the inhibition rate of cells were detected by MTT assay. The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein among the A2780 and A2780/T cells treated respectively with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL was detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot. The A2780/T cells were divided into blank group,empty group,small interfering RNA (siRNA) XIAP group and siRNA-non-specific group. The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein of four groups were detected by RT-qPCR and Western blot. Apoptotic rate of these groups with addition of paclitaxel at the concentrations of 0 ng/mL,1 000 ng/mL,1 500 ng/mL,2 000 ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL were detected by flow cytometry., RESULTS: After the treatments on A2780 and A2780/T cells with the different concentrations of paclitaxel,the inhibition rate of A2780 cells were gradually increased with the increased paclitaxel concentrations (P<0.05),while there were no obvious differences in A2780/T cells (P>0.05). After the treatment on these cells with paclitaxel at the concentration of 100 ng/mL,the expression of XIAP mRNA was lower than that non-treatment with paclitaxelin A2780 cells (P<0.05),and the expression of XIAP mRNA in the A2780/T cells were no statistical significance between the treatment group and non-treatment group with paclitaxel (P>0.05). However,the expression of A2780/T cells'XIAP mRNA and protein treated with paclitaxel were higher than A2780 cells' (P<0.05). The expression of XIAP mRNA and protein in siRNA-XIAP group was lower than those of other groups (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of siRNA-XIAP group was higher than those of other groups treated with the paclitaxel at concentrations of 2 000 ng/mL and 2 500 ng/mL (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: XIAP's high expression on mRNA and protein was correlated with ovarian cancer paclitaxel-resistance,specific siRNA can promote cell apoptosis by reducing the expression of XIAP,and increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to paclitaxel.

N2  -  Therapeutic effects of anti-cancer drugs for ovarian cancer were limited due to the rapid development of chemotherapy resistance. The aim of this study was to test whether knockdown of Homeobox B4 (HOXB4) enhanced the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells. HOXB4 expressions at mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in Taxol-resistant A2780 (A2780/Taxol) and DDP-resistant SKOV-3 (SKOV-3/DDP) cells. HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells, respectively. HOXB4 silencing suppressed the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway and reduced the expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in ovarian cancer cells. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or siRNA targeting Akt (si-Akt) treatment inhibited cell viability, decreased protein levels of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2, and increased LDH release in A2780/Taxol and SKOV-3/DDP cells. These findings revealed that HOXB4 knockdown enhanced the cytotoxic effects of Taxol and DDP by downregulating ABC transporters via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway in ovarian cancer cells.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) encapsulated in albumin (Abraxane R) is an FDA approved frontline nano-formulation for treating advance metastatic pancreatic, lung and breast cancers. Currently in clinic, Abraxane R is being used as a one of the components of combination therapy regimens. On the other hand, difluorinated curcumin (CDF) is a novel and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is being evaluated for several malignancies including pancreatic, liver, ovarian and breast cancers. To improve the bioavailability and targeting ability of hydrophobic PTX and CDF, we have encapsulated them in folic acid decorated bovine serum albumin nanoparticles, namely FA-BSA-PTX and FA-BSA-CDF, respectively. Both the formulations yielded uniform nano-sized particles with smooth surface morphology, negative surface potential and high drug loading efficiency. Due to heterogeneity and complexity of several cancers, combination regimens are becoming standard arsenals against several deadly cancers. To evaluate the synergistic anti-cancer effect of PTX and CDF, we assessed the combination therapy using intravenously administrable folate decorated albumin bio-conjugate nanoparticles against folate overexpressing ovarian and cervical cancers. Our results demonstrate that combination of FA-BSA-CDF with FA-BSA-PTX produced synergistic anticancer effect, augmented due to folate receptor mediated targeted uptake as well as induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, our preliminary studies show a promising nanomedicine platform for combination therapy for leading gynecological tumor, such as ovarian and cervical cancer.

N2  -  Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components of mesenchymal cells in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. They are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemotherapy resistance by directly contacting with cancer cells or secretory cytokines. In the present study, we examined the role of CAFs in the induction of EMT in ovarian cancer. Primary ovarian cancer cells, CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from fresh cancer tissue and cultured for immunohistochemistry studies. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression of IL-6 in the culture supernatants of these cells. The expression of IL-6 at the mRNA level was examined by RT-PCR. The expression of IL-6 at the protein level in ovarian cancer tissues was determined using an immunofluorescence assay in both tissue sections and cell lobes. OVCAR3 cells were treated with the culture supernatants collected from CAFs and NFs. IL-6 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was employed to neutralize IL-6. The expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was assessed. Changes in EMT, proliferation, invasion and proapoptotic protein expression were also examined. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the changes in apoptosis resistance of OVCAR3 cells. The JAK2/STAT3 pathway-specific inhibitor AG490 was used to block this pathway and the beta-TGF inhibitor was used to inhibit EMT. The clinical data of patients treated in our hospital were collected between January 1st, 2009 and June 30th, 2013. The expression of interstitial IL-6 in paraffin-embedded tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the expression of interstitial IL-6 and the treatment response was examined by linear regression and multiple linear regression analyses. We found that CAFs were the main source of IL-6 in ovarian cancer tissue. CAFs promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 in ovarian cancer and enhanced the proliferation, invasion and EMT. Enhanced EMT may lead to apoptosis resistance, inhibitory expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and paclitaxel resistance. A total of 255 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that age, CA125, interstitial IL-6 expression and cytoreduction satisfaction were closely related to the sensitivity of the TP (docetaxel plus cisplatin or carbopatin) regimen in ovarian cancer (P<0.05). These results demonstrated that CAFs highly secreted IL-6 and promoted beta-TGF-mediated EMT in ovarian cancer via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, leading to inhibited apoptosis and subsequent paclitaxel resistance. Therefore, CAFs may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) belongs to a class of taxane anti-tumor drug used for the clinic treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and so on. PTX has poor water solubility and oral bioavailability. It is generally administered via intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Traditional PTX injectable preparations contain Cremophor-EL and ethanol to improve its solubility, which would result in adverse reactions like severe hypersensitivity, neutropenia, etc. Adverse reactions can be reduced only by complicated pretreatment with glucocorticoid and antihistamines drugs and followed by PTX slow infusion for three hours, which has brought significant inconvenience to the patients. Though, a new-generation PTX formulation, Abraxane, free of Cremophor-EL and ethanol, is still being administrated by frequent i.v. infusions and extremely expensive. Therefore, non-injection administration of PTX is urgently needed to avoid the side effects as well as reduce inconvenience to the patients. Recently, a variety of non-injection drug delivery systems (DDSs) of PTX have been developed. This review aims to discuss the progress of non-injectable administration systems of PTX, including oral administration systems, vaginal administration systems, implantable DDSs, transdermal DDSs and intranasal administration for the future study and clinical applications.

N2  -  Here we report a case of pancreatic cancer(PC)with peritoneal dissemination, underwent conversion surgery following chemotherapy for 2 years. A5 5-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for treatment of PC. Abdominal CT scan revealed 3.0 cm of a pancreatic head tumor with abutment of the portal vein and the hepatic artery, classified as borderline resectable. Staging laparoscopy(SL)showed positive peritoneal cytology(CY). Gemcitabine(Gem)plus S-1 therapy(GS) was performed. Ten months after initial GS, SL revealed the disseminated nodule and positive CY. The regimen was changed to Gem plus nab-paclitaxel therapy(Gem plus nab-PTX). Since right ovarian tumor was detected by CT scan 6 months after initial Gem plus nab-PTX, laparoscopic oophorectomy was performed. Histological findings showed positive CY and ovarian metastasis of PC. Afterward, Gem plus nab-PTX has been continued for 8 months. Since SL after 2 years from initial chemotherapy showed negative CY and no metastatic lesion, pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection was performed as conversion surgery. According to General Rules for the Study of Pancreatic Cancer the 7th edition by Japan Pancreas Society, histological findings showed ypT3, ypN0, R0, and Grade 1b of histological effect. The patient is alive without recurrence 6 months after the resection.

N2  -  We report here that toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and ABCB1 are upregulated in SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma cells that acquired resistance to the anticancer drug taxol. Silencing of TLR4 using short-hairpin RNA sensitized taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells to taxol (4.6 fold), whereas ectopic expression of TLR4 in parental, taxol-sensitive SKOV3 cells or TLR4-null HEK293 cells induced taxol resistance (~2 fold). A sub-lethal dose of taxol induced ABCB1 protein expression in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. Inactivation of TLR4 using chemical inhibitors (CLI-095 and AO-I) downregulated ABCB1 protein expression and enhanced the cytotoxic activity of taxol in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. While the sensitization effect of TLR4 inactivation was also detected in TOV21G ovarian cancer cells, which express moderate level of TLR4, ectopic expression of ABCB1 prevented the sensitization effect in these cells. Notably, the NFkappaB pathway was significantly activated by taxol, and inhibition of this pathway suppressed TLR4-regulated ABCB1 expression. Furthermore, taxol-induced NFkappaB signaling was reduced following TLR4 silencing in taxol-resistant SKOV3 cells. Consistent with these results, ectopic expression of TLR4 in taxol-sensitive SKOV3 cells enhanced ABCB1 expression and conferred resistance to taxol. The protective effect of exogenous TLR4 expression against taxol was reduced by treatment with NFkappaB inhibitor in these cells. These results demonstrate that taxol activates the TLR4-NFkappaB pathway which in turn induces ABCB1 gene expression. This cellular pathway thus represents a novel target to limit resistance to taxol in ovarian cancer cells. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is an anticancer agent efficacious in the treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancer. Due to a strong link between the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel, we reviewed the literature on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Systematic data mining was performed to extract the maximum concentration (C max), clearance (CL), and time of paclitaxel plasma concentration above 0.05 micromol/L (T > 0.05 micromol/L) following monotherapy of both the widely used cremophor-diluted paclitaxel and nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab-)paclitaxel. We identified a total of 53 studies yielding 121 aggregated pharmacokinetic profiles for paclitaxel monotherapy and extracted reported mean and median estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. Paclitaxel has been studied formally at doses of 15-825 mg/m2 and infused over 0.5-96 h; included studies examined both weekly and every 3-weeks dosing cycles. The most widely used dose of cremophor-diluted paclitaxel, 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-h infusion, leads to an interstudy median C max of 5.1 micromol/L [interquartile range (IQR) 4.5-5.7], CL of 12.0 L/h/m2 (IQR 10.9-12.9), and T > 0.05 micromol/L of 23.8 h (IQR 21.5-26.8). Importantly, the significant interindividual variation widely reported in the literature is not reflected in these interstudy estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters. Cremophor-diluted paclitaxel pharmacokinetics are non-linear following short (<6 h) but not long (>24 h) infusions. A similar pattern of non-linearity was observed for nab-paclitaxel, although the number of studies was limited. The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel monotherapy have been widely studied at numerous dose levels of the Cremophor EL R formulation, but are less well-characterized for the newer nab-paclitaxel formulation. In conclusion, paclitaxel pharmacokinetics are non-linear for short infusion times but not for longer infusions. Whether a similar conclusion can be drawn for nab-paclitaxel formulations requires further study.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic malignant tumors. The major obstacle to treatment success is multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy drugs. Cepharanthine hydrochloride (CH), a natural alkaloid-derived compound, has shown MDR reversal potency in several tumor cell lines; however, the molecular mechanism is not entirely known. In the present study, we assessed whether CH sensitized malignant cells to chemotherapy drugs in ovarian cancer and explored the relevant mechanism. We found that CH reduced the IC50 value of paclitaxel and increased intracellular rhodamine-123 accumulation in human ovarian cancer A2780/Taxol cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay demonstrated that CH inhibited MDR1 expression as indicated by reduced mRNA and protein levels in A2780/Taxol cells. In addition, the inhibitory effect was strengthened after CH was combined with the specific PI3K/Akt signaling pathway inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, p-Akt expression decreased gradually with the concentration of CH (2, 4 and 8 microM). Taken together, these findings indicated that CH reversed P-glycoprotein-mediated MDR in A2780/Taxol cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, when poorly responsive to standard treatment. First-line treatment consists in schemes including cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy schemes with platinum and taxane derivatives. Second-line regimens are based on gemcitabine and liposomal doxorubicin. Third line is often not worthwhile because of the high toxicity with poor response to treatment. Previously, we showed that paclitaxel (PTX) carried in non-protein lipid core nanoparticles (LDE) resembling the chemical structure of LDL has remarkably reduced toxicity. Here, the hypothesis was tested whether PTX-LDE could safely benefit patients in third-line treatment setting. Fourteen women unresponsive to second-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, aged 61 +/- 10 years, clinical stage IV and TqNqM1, were included. PTX-LDE was administered at 175 mg/m2, 3/3 week dose. Patients were submitted to clinical examinations before each chemotherapy cycle. Serum biochemistry and imaging examinations to monitor disease progression were performed. In total, 74 cycles of chemotherapy were done and, in all cycles, clinical or laboratorial toxicities were not observed. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% CI 2.0-3.9). In four patients, PFS was >6 months and in 2 > 1 year. The unpreceded, striking absence of toxicity and consistently long PFS, compared to previous results, indicate that at least 4 among 14 patients had tumor arrest by the treatment and clear benefit of PTX-LDE at third-line setting. The absence of observable toxicity allows dose escalating to improve response to treatment, as perspective to be tested in the ensuing studies.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab (P) is an anti-PD-1 antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on T-cells and PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumour cells. A phase Ib trial of P plus chemotherapy was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy., METHODS: Patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumours were enrolled onto one of six treatment arms. Pembrolizumab was given: with gemcitabine (G), G+docetaxel (D), G+nab-paclitaxel (NP), G+vinorelbine (V) or irinotecan (I) until progression or toxicity, or with liposomal doxorubicin (LD) for up to 15 cycles, progression or toxicity. Safety monitoring and response assessments were conducted., RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were enrolled and treated. The most common adverse events were transaminitis, cytopenias, rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Arm 2 was closed due to poor accrual. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined for Arms 1, 3a, 4, 5 and 6. There were eight partial responses across multiple tumour types., CONCLUSIONS: Standard dose P can be safely combined with G, G+NP, G+V, I and LD. Efficacy was observed in multiple tumour types and evaluation to determine if response and duration of response are more robust than what would be expected for chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone requires further validation.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate the effect and mechanism of CRM197, the heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) inhibitor, on the reverse of the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel. Methods: (1)The effect of CRM197 on the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) of human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780/Taxol was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Western blot was used to detect the effect of CRM197 on the expression of HB-EGF, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-gp) protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol cells. Real-time PCR was used to examine the MDR1 mRNA expression in these cells. (2) A2780/Taxol cells were divided into 4 groups, including the cells transfected with empty vector and saline treatment (empty vector group), MDR1 small interference RNA (siRNA) vector and saline treatment (MDR1 siRNA group), empty vector and CRM197 treatment (empty vector+CRM197 group) and MDR1 siRNA vector and CRM197 treatment (MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group), respectively. Flow cytometry was used to detecte the effect of intracellular rhodomine 123 (Rh123) accumulation, and caspase-3 activity assay was used to test the effect of apoptosis in four groups of A2780/Taxol cells. (3) In experiments in vivo, A2780/Taxol cells were inoculated to nude mouse subcutaneously to determine the EGFR and P-gp protein expression following CRM197 treatment by immunohistochemistry. Results: (1) In vitro, MTT examination showed that the IC(50) of A2780/Taxol cells to paclitaxel in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group [(6.4+/-0.3) mumol/L] was significantly lower than the IC(50) in A2780/Taxol group [ (34.1+/-0.5) mumol/L, P<0.01], and the reveral fold of CRM197 was 5.3. The expression level of HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group (1.44+/-0.29) was significantly lower than HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol group (2.72+/-0.32), respectively (P<0.05). The expression level of EGFR protein (0.71+/-0.25) and P-gp protein (0.82+/-0.19) in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was significantly lower than EGFR protein (1.87+/-0.31) and P-gp protein (1.84+/-0.27) of A2780/Taxol group (P<0.05). Compared with A2780/Taxol group (1.78+/-0.27) , MDR1 mRNA was significantly down-regulated in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group (0.79+/-0.13, P<0.05). (2) The fluorescence intensity of Rh123 of the A2780/Taxol cells in empty vector group, MDR1 siRNA group,empty vector+CRM197 group, MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group was 33.4+/-1.6, 56.3+/-3.3, 43.5+/-3.1,100.4+/-7.4, and the pNA of the A2780/Taxol cells was (11.4+/-1.2) , (52.8+/-0.9) , (71.2+/-3.6) , (82.7+/-3.8) mumol/L. The expression levels in MDR1 siRNA+CRM197 group were both higher than the expression levels in empty vector+CRM197 group, and the expression levels in empty vector+CRM197 group, MDR1 siRNA group were both higher than the expression levels in empty vector group (P<0.05). (3) In vivo, the expression scores of EGFR protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 tumors (4.4+/-1.4) were lower than that in A2780/Taxol tumors (10.2+/-3.1, P<0.05). The expression scores of P-gp protein in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 tumors (3.8+/-1.1) were lower than that in A2780/Taxol tumors (8.8+/-2.7, P<0.05). Conclusion:  CRM197 reverses the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel by increasing caspase-3 activity to advance apoptosis via EGFR/MDR1/P-gp pathway.

N2  -  Albumin-bound paclitaxel colloidal nanoparticle (Abraxane R) is an FDA approved anticancer formulation available in the market. It is a suspension which is currently used therapeutically for treating cancers of the breast, lung, and pancreas among others. CDF is a novel new and potent synthetic curcumin analogue that is widely used for breast and ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to use biocompatible albumin as well as folate decorated albumin to formulate colloidal nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin difluorinated (CDF). CDF has demonstrated a 16-fold improvement in stability and remarkable anticancer potency compared to its natural derivative, curcumin. CDF showed marked inhibition of cancer cell growth through down-regulation of multiple miRNAs, up-regulation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and attenuation of histone methyl transferase EZH2. However, CDF is highly hydrophobic and photodegradable with sparing aqueous solubility. In this study, we have formulated albumin nanoparticle using a modified desolvation method, which yielded high CDF loading in a nanoformulation. The physicochemical properties of CDF loaded albumin and folate-decorated albumin nanosuspensions were assessed for particle size, morphology, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency/loading, solubility and drug release. Importantly, the folate ligand decorated albumin nanoparticles were formulated in principle to passively and actively target folate-overexpressing-cancers. In this study, the synthesis and optimization of BSA and folate decorated BSA conjugated CDF nanoparticles are assessed in detail that will be useful for its future clinical translation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates immunity via recruitment of antigen presenting cells and tumor specific T-cell stimulation. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) followed by GM-CSF may enhance antitumor responses and prolong remissions in ovarian cancer. Immune phenotypes present before treatment may identify responders to chemo-immunotherapy., METHODS: Recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer patients received nab-paclitaxel, 100mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 followed by GM-CSF 250mug days 16-26 every 28days for 6 planned cycles. The primary endpoint was remission duration compared to immediate prior remission. Peripheral blood was evaluated by flow cytometry and interferon-gamma ELISPOT., RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled. Six patients (29%) achieved a biochemical complete response and 9 (43%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 72%. Median time to progression was 4months and 10% of patients achieved longer remissions than the immediate prior regimen. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.8months. Fewer myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) at enrollment significantly associated with complete response (p=0.05). T-cell responses to IGF1R-p1332-1346 (r=0.827, p=0.0003) and IGF1R-p1242-1256 (r=0.850, p=0.0001) during treatment correlated with time to progression., CONCLUSIONS: Nab-paclitaxel combined with GM-CSF demonstrated biochemical responses in a majority of patients, although responses were not sustained. This combination did not demonstrate an advantage in OS over prior studies of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy. Agents that modulate MDSC should be studied as potential adjuvants to therapy. Strategies to expand T cells recognizing tumor-associated antigens biologically significant in ovarian cancer should also continue to be investigated. Copyright A© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  Background and Aims: Ovarian carcinoma (OC) is one of the most lethal malignant tumors with a high reoccurrence and chemoresistance. The key mechanism relationship with chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma is still unclear. The existence of cancer stem cells involves in chemoresistance and reoccurrence in OC. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression, suppression of malignant properties and reversal of paclitaxel resistance inhibiting RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 with siRNA in ovarian cancer cells. Methods: The expression of MSI-1 was analyzed in 39 normal ovarian epithelia tissues, 92 serous cystadenomas, 68 borderline serous cystadenomas, and 97 serous cystadenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry. pLKO.1-MSI-1-siRNA expression vector was transfected into ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and its paclitaxel-resistant cell subline A2780/Taxol. The roles of MSI-1 in proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were explored by cell proliferation analysis, Caspase 3 activity assay, wound healing assay, migration and matrigel invasion assay, respectively. Western Blotting and Real-time quantitative PCR were conducted to detect the expression of MSI-1 and the ERK signaling pathway. Reversal of paclitaxel resistance assay was used to evaluate the role of MSI-1 in paclitaxel resistance of OC cells. Finally, therapeutic effects of MSI-1 inhibition were investigated the xenogratfs of SCID mice in vivo of the paclitacel-resistant. Results: MSI-1 is overexpressed and associated with an unfavorable prognosis in OC patients. Knockdown of MSI-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits proliferation, promotes apoptosis, and reduces migration and invasion of cancer cells. Moreover, MSI-1 expression inhibition reverses paclitaxel-resistance in OC cells. We further display that MSI-1 effectively protects OC cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by increasing the expression of p-Bcl-2 through ERK signaling pathway activation. In vivo, MSI-1 siRNA clearly showed a strong effect on tumor growth inhibition and paclitaxel-resistance reversal. Conclusions: These findings suggest that MSI-1 overexpression is associated with the prognosis of OC patients, and knockdown of MSI-1 can suppress malignant properties and reverse paclitaxel-resistance in OC cells. MSI-1 maybe act as a potential prognostic indicator and a therapeutic target in OC.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles hold considerable promise for aerosol-based intraperitoneal delivery in patients with carcinomatosis. Recently, results from preclinical and early clinical trials suggested that albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABP, Abraxane TM) may result in superior efficacy in the treatment of peritoneal metastases (PM) compared to the standard solvent-based paclitaxel formulation (Taxol TM). Here, we propose a phase I study of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) using ABP in patients with upper Gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer., METHODS: Eligible patients with advanced, biopsy-proven PM from ovarian, breast, gastric, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic origin will undergo three PIPAC treatments using ABP with a 4-week interval. The dose of ABP will be escalated from 35 to 140 mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the maximally tolerated dose is determined. The primary end point is dose-limiting toxicity. Secondary analyses include surgical morbidity, non-access rate, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, quality of life, and exploratory circulating biomarker analyses., DISCUSSION: ABP holds considerable promise for intraperitoneal aerosol delivery. The aim of this study is to determine the dose level for future randomized phase II trials using ABP in PIPAC therapy., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as EudraCT: 2017-001688-20 and Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03304210.

N2  -  Chemotherapy is an important adjuvant therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The main cause of chemotherapy failure in EOC is paclitaxel resistance. The present study aimed to identify novel biomarkers to predict chemosensitivity to paclitaxel and improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance in EOC. In the present study, the heterogeneity of EOC was evaluated by adenosine triphosphate-tumor chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) in vitro. Fresh samples were collected from 54 EOC cases during cytoreductive surgery. Tumor cells were isolated, cultured, and tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel. Proteins that were differentially expressed between paclitaxel-resistant tissues and paclitaxel-sensitive tissues were identified via isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis. Two upregulated proteins, plexin domain containing 2 (Plxdc2) and cytokeratin 7 (CK7), were selected to verify the iTRAQ method using western blot analysis in EOC tissues with different chemosensitivities (sensitive, weakly sensitive and resistant). There was notable heterogeneity of chemosensitivity in the EOC specimens. Highly to mildly-differentiated or early-stage (I/II) EOC specimens had decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel compared with specimens with low differentiation (P<0.05) or an advanced stage (III; P<0.05), respectively. A total of 496 significantly differentially expressed proteins, including 263 that were downregulated (P<0.05) and 233 that were upregulated (P<0.05) in paclitaxel-resistant tissues compared with paclitaxel-sensitive tissues, were identified using iTRAQ in combination with LC-MS/MS. The expression levels of two proteins associated with paclitaxel resistance, Plxdc2 and CK7, were further validated by western blotting, which revealed that they were upregulated in the paclitaxel-resistant tissues. The present study determined candidate proteins associated with paclitaxel resistance in EOC. Plxdc2 and CK7 may be potential makers for distinguishing patients with paclitaxel-resistant EOC from those with paclitaxel-sensitive EOC.

N2  -  The taxanes are effective microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapy drugs that inhibit mitosis, induce apoptosis, and produce regression in a fraction of cancers that arise at many sites including the ovary. Novel therapeutic targets that augment taxane effects are needed to improve clinical chemotherapy response in CCNE1-amplified high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells. In this study, we conducted an siRNA-based kinome screen to identify modulators of mitotic progression in CCNE1-amplified HGSOC cells that may influence clinical paclitaxel response. PLK1 is overexpressed in many types of cancer, which correlates with poor prognosis. Here, we identified a novel synthetic lethal interaction of the clinical PLK1 inhibitor BI6727 and the microtubule-targeting drug paclitaxel in HGSOC cell lines with CCNE1-amplification and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of this synergism. BI6727 synergistically induces apoptosis together with paclitaxel in different cell lines including a patient-derived primary ovarian cancer culture. Moreover, the inhibition of PLK1 reduced the paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity in a neurite outgrowth assay. Mechanistically, the combinatorial treatment with BI6727/paclitaxel triggers mitotic arrest, which initiates mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, followed by significant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-dependent effector pathways. This conclusion is supported by data showing that BI6727/paclitaxel-co-treatment stabilizes FBW7, a component of SCF-type ubiquitin ligases that bind and regulate key modulators of cell division and growth including MCL-1 and Cyclin E. This identification of a novel synthetic lethality of PLK1 inhibitors and a microtubule-stabilizing drug has important implications for developing PLK1 inhibitor-based combination treatments in CCNE1-amplified HGSOC cells.

N2  -  The intraperitoneal (IP) administration of antineoplastic agents has been proposed as a method to improve the efficacy of therapy of malignant disease principally confined to the peritoneal cavity especially in carcinoma-ovary. Our patient who had more tumor burden in the peritoneum was refractory to two lines intravenous (IV) chemotherapy who improved on IP administration of platinum and IV nab paclitaxel chemotherapy regime. A 42-year-old lady was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer. She suffered from progressive disease on two lines of IV chemotherapy following surgery with persistent rise in serum CA 125 level. Administration of IP platinum and IV nab paclitaxel chemotherapy regime resulted in complete (metabolic/radiological) response with normal CA 125 level. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be considered in patients with ovarian cancer with predominantly peritoneal disease. Copyright © Indian Association of Surgical Oncology 2017.

N2  -  Aim: The microtubule-associated Tau protein is a marker of paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the function of the Tau protein in epithelial ovarian cancer., Methods: The correlation between Tau protein expression and the response to paclitaxel by using several ovarian cancer cell lines was investigated., Results: A Western blot showed that the expression level of the Tau protein was the highest in the TOV112D cells. A cell-counting kit showed that the proliferation rates were more inhibited in the cells with down-regulated Tau protein than in the control cells, both with and without paclitaxel treatment. The proliferation rates of the control cells and the TOV112D cells also were compared with Tau protein overexpression. The level of cell proliferation was more inhibited in the cells that overexpressed the Tau protein, compared to the control cells, both with and without paclitaxel treatment. It was shown that both the down-regulation and the overexpression of the Tau protein were related to the inhibition of TOV112D cell proliferation. Early and late apoptosis of the TOV112D cells that were transfected with Tau cDNA plasmid construct or Tau small interfering RNA significantly increased., Conclusion: These findings suggest that the molecular targeting of the Tau protein could be a potential treatment for ovarian cancer.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), an albumin-binding protein, is downregulated by hypermethylation in many cancers. Hypomethylating agents such as azacitidine can upregulate SPARC in tumors, which may enhance the accumulation of albumin-bound drugs at tumor site. The objectives of this phase I trial was to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose and to assess any clinical activity of the combination of azacytidine and weekly nanoparticle-albumin-bound (nab R) paclitaxel., METHODS: Patients received escalating azacytidine doses daily for 5 days, followed by nab-paclitaxel at the standard 100mg/m2 weekly dose for 3 weeks in 4-week cycles. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were monitored during the first cycle. Serum was obtained at baseline, during and after treatment for correlative study., RESULTS: All sixteen total patients enrolled were evaluable for toxicity, while 13 patients were evaluable for response. Two of five patients treated with 100mg/m2 of azacytidine had DLT of prolonged grade 4 neutropenia. Therefore, the MTD of azacitidine in this regimen is 75 mg/m2. Three additional patients were treated with no grade 4 toxicity in cycle 1. Clinical activity included 1 complete response (CR) in refractory DLBCL, 2 CR in ovarian cancer, 4 partial responses (PR) in ovarian and endometrial cancer, 4 stable diseases (SD) in lung, sarcoma and pancreatic cancer, 1 unconfirmed PR in breast cancer, and 1 progression of disease in CLL/SLL., CONCLUSIONS: Priming with azacitidine 75 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, followed by weekly nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 weekly was well tolerated and results in dramatic responses pre-treated cancer patients.

N2  -  Forced expression of the cytokine-induced large GTPase, human Guanylate-Binding Protein-1 (hGBP-1), in ovarian cancer cell lines increases resistance to paclitaxel. Elevated hGBP-1 RNA in ovarian tumors correlates with shorter recurrence-free survival. In contract, hGBP-1 is part of a gene signature predicting improved prognosis in all subtypes of breast cancers. hGBP-1 does not confer paclitaxel resistance on MCF-7 and TMX2-28 breast cancer cells. Expression of the isotype of the hGBP-1-interacting protein, PIM1, which may contribute to paclitaxel resistance when associated with hGBP-1, is different in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell lines express the 44 kDa isoform of PIM-1, and ovarian cancer cell lines express the 33 kDa isoform. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  -  Taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel) are among the most commonly prescribed anticancer drugs approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast, non-small cell lung, prostate, gastric, head and neck, and ovarian cancers, as well as in the adjuvant setting for operable node-positive breast cancers. Although the true incidence of dermatological adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving taxanes is not known, and has never been prospectively analysed, they clearly represent one of the major AEs associated with these agents. With an increase in the occurrence of cutaneous AEs during treatment with novel targeted and immunological therapies when used in combination with taxanes, a thorough understanding of reactions attributable to this class is imperative. Moreover, identification and management of dermatological AEs is critical for maintaining the quality of life in cancer patients and for minimizing dose modifications of their antineoplastic regimen. This analysis represents a systematic review of the dermatological conditions reported with the use of these drugs, complemented by experience at comprehensive cancer centres. The conditions reported herein include skin, hair, and nail toxicities. Lastly, we describe the dermatological data available for the new, recently FDA-and EMA- approved, solvent-free nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To study the anti-tumor effects of octreotide on A2780/Taxol ovarian cancer cells in vitro, and further explore its potential molecular mechanism., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunocytochemistry was performed to determine the expression of SSTR2 on A2780/Taxol cells. Octreotide at different concentrations (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 nmol/ml) were administrated to A2780/Taxol cells in vitro. CCK-8 assay was used to measure the effects on cell proliferation, and the cytometry of octreotide determined the cell apoptosis. The expressions of SSTR2 MDR1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay and the expressions of the above protein were investigated after A2780/Taxol was treated with octreotide for 48 hours by western blot in vitro., RESULTS: Positive expression of SSTR2 was observed on the membrane of A2780/Taxol cells. The proliferation of A2780/Taxol cells was gradually inhibited with increasing octreotide concentration in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Meanwhile, flow cytometry data demonstrated the octreotide-induced cell apoptosis. The results of SSTR2 mRNA suggested that there was no significant difference between each concentration group of octreotide (P > 0.05). Compared with the control group, both the MDR1 and VEGF mRNA decreased in a dose-dependent manner following 48 hours of treatment of octreotide (P < 0.05). The results of western blot showed that octreotide decreased the expressions of SSTR2, MDR1, and VEGF protein in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide significantly inhibits ovarian cancer's proliferation and promotes its apoptosis via the cell surface expression of SSTR2. It could be used as a new targeted drug for treatment of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Most patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with unresectable or metastatic disease with very poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for patients with locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, but the efficacy of currently available regimens is limited. Taxanes are widely used in many primary cancers including breast, ovarian and lung cancers. The activity of combined regimen of taxanes plus nucleoside analogue or platinum derivate in terms of response rate ranges between 20 and 57 % in PDAC and may prolong overall survival. Since 2013 nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel-albumin-bound particles) became a new treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the results of MPACT trial. Moreover, encouraging activity in PDAC of the combination regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin that is being widely used in other solid tumors has been reported recently. Biomarkers, including biomarkers predictive of taxane resistance, could allow individualized tailored therapy. BRCA mutation status could serve as predictor of better chemotherapy treatment outcome in PDAC. The present review summarizes the principal clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of taxanes both as monotherapy and in combination in view of the potential use in the treatment of PDAC.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: The dynamic changes that occur in protein expression after treatment of a cancer in vivo are poorly described. In this study we measure the effect of chemotherapy over time on the expression of a panel of proteins in ovarian cancer xenograft models. The objective was to identify phosphoprotein and other protein changes indicative of pathway activation that might link with drug response., METHODS: Two xenograft models, platinum-responsive OV1002 and platinum-unresponsive HOX424, were used. Treatments were carboplatin and carboplatin-paclitaxel. Expression of 49 proteins over 14 days post treatment was measured by quantitative immunofluorescence and analysed by AQUA., RESULTS: Carboplatin treatment in the platinum-sensitive OV1002 model triggered up-regulation of cell cycle, mTOR and DDR pathways, while at late time points WNT, invasion, EMT and MAPK pathways were modulated. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) and ERBB pathways were down-regulated early, within 24 h from treatment administration. Combined carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment triggered a more extensive response in the OV1002 model modulating expression of 23 of 49 proteins. Therefore the cell cycle and DDR pathways showed similar or more pronounced changes than with carboplatin alone. In addition to expression of pS6 and pERK increasing, components of the AKT pathway were modulated with pAKT increasing while its regulator PTEN was down-regulated early. WNT signaling, EMT and invasion markers were modulated at later time points. Additional pathways were also observed with the NFkappaB and JAK/STAT pathways being up-regulated. ESR1 was down-regulated as was HER4, while further protein members of the ERBB pathway were upregulated late. By contrast, in the carboplatin-unresponsive HOX 424 xenograft, carboplatin only modulated expression of MLH1 while carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment modulated ESR1 and pMET., CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen proteins were modulated by carboplatin and a more robust set of changes by carboplatin-paclitaxel. Early changes included DDR and cell cycle regulatory proteins associating with tumor volume changes, as expected. Changes in ESR1 and ERBB signaling were also observed. Late changes included components of MAPK signaling, EMT and invasion markers and coincided in time with reversal in tumor volume reduction. These results suggest potential therapeutic roles for inhibitors of such pathways that may prolong chemotherapeutic effects.

N2  -  Peritoneal carcinomatosis is present in more than 60% of gastric cancer, 40% of ovarian cancer, and 35% of colon cancer patients. It is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality, with a median survival of 1 to 3 months. Cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy is the current clinical treatment, but achieving curative drug accumulation and penetration in peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we used flexible and pH-sensitive polymersomes for payload delivery to peritoneal gastric (MKN-45P) and colon (CT26) carcinoma in mice. Polymersomes were loaded with paclitaxel and in vitro drug release was studied as a function of pH and time. Paclitaxel-loaded polymersomes remained stable in aqueous solution at neutral pH for up to 4 months. In cell viability assay on cultured cancer cell lines (MKN-45P, SKOV3, CT26), paclitaxel-loaded polymersomes were more toxic than free drug or albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane). Intraperitoneally administered fluorescent polymersomes accumulated in malignant lesions, and immunofluorescence revealed an intense signal inside tumors with no detectable signal in control organs. A dual targeting of tumors was observed: direct (circulation-independent) penetration, and systemic, blood vessel-associated accumulation. Finally, we evaluated preclinical antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel-polymersomes in the treatment of MKN-45P disseminated gastric carcinoma using a total dose of 7 mg/kg. Experimental therapy with paclitaxel-polymersomes improved the therapeutic index of drug over free paclitaxel and Abraxane, as evaluated by intraperitoneal tumor burden and number of metastatic nodules. Our findings underline the potential utility of the polymersome platform for delivery of drugs and imaging agents to peritoneal carcinomatosis lesions. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(4); 670-9. ©2016 AACR.

N2  -  We present a rare case of taxane-pretreated metastatic gastric cancer with an excellent response to nab-paclitaxel. A 66- year-old woman was diagnosed with Stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma (T4aN3M1[LYM, OTH]P1CY1). She failed to respond to multiple chemotherapeutic regimens including S-1, capecitabine, cisplatin, L-OHP, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and CPT- 11. Finally, 6th line chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel was tried. After 4 courses of nab-paclitaxel, a CT scan revealed decreasing ascites and a reduction in the size of the ovary metastasis. She experienced a clinical response for about 4 months. The adverse events were only Grade 1 peripheral sensory neuropathy and joint pain, and her performance status improved during the treatment period.

N2  -  There is growing recognition of the important role of metronomic chemotherapy in cancer treatment. On the basis of their unique antiangiogenic effects, we tested the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel, which stimulates thrombospondin-1, and topotecan, which inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, at metronomic dosing for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. In vitro and in vivo SKOV3ip1, HeyA8, and HeyA8-MDR (taxane-resistant) orthotopic models were used to examine the effects of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. We examined cell proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3), and angiogenesis (microvessel density, MVD) in tumors obtained at necropsy. In vivo therapy experiments demonstrated treatment with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and in combination with metronomic topotecan resulted in significant reductions in tumor weight (62% in the SKOV3ip1 model, P < 0.01 and 96% in the HeyA8 model, P < 0.03) compared with vehicle (P < 0.01). In the HeyA8-MDR model, metronomic monotherapy with either cytotoxic agent had modest effects on tumor growth, but combination therapy decreased tumor burden by 61% compared with vehicle (P < 0.03). The greatest reduction in MVD (P < 0.05) and proliferation was seen in combination metronomic therapy groups. Combination metronomic therapy resulted in prolonged overall survival in vivo compared with other groups (P < 0.001). Tube formation was significantly inhibited in RF-24 endothelial cells exposed to media conditioned with metronomic nab-paclitaxel alone and media conditioned with combination metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan. The combination of metronomic nab-paclitaxel and metronomic topotecan offers a novel, highly effective therapeutic approach for ovarian carcinoma that merits further clinical development.

N2  -  We propose CHI3L1 as a prognostic biomarker for patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and also suggest possible biological functions of CHI3L1. We measured CHI3L1 expression with quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 180 women with EOC and evaluated correlations between CHI3L1 expression, clinicopathological characteristics, and the outcomes of the patients. The expression of CHI3L1 was higher in cancerous tissues than in normal tissues. The expression of CHI3L1 was also higher in patients with a serous histological type, advanced stage, and chemoresistance. Patients with high CHI3L1 expression had a shorter progression-free survival (p < 0.001)and overall survival (p < 0.001). Patients with high CHI3L1 expression also had a high risk of recurrence (p < 0.001)and death (p < 0.001). In vitro studies showed that CHI3L1 up-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein and hampered paclitaxel-induced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. These results suggest that CHI3L1 shows potential as a prognostic biomarker for EOC. CHI3L1 may promote chemoresistance via inhibition of drug-induced apoptosis by up-regulating Mcl-1.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is recommended as a first-line chemotherapeutic agent against ovarian cancer, but drug resistance becomes a major limitation of its success clinically. The key molecule or mechanism associated with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer still remains unclear. Sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) is of vital importance in the regulation of stem cell proliferation and carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of SOX2 in ovarian cancer tumorigenesis and paclitaxel resistance. In the present study, the expression of SOX2 was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR in 40 clinical samples and in SKOV3 cells and SKOV3/TAX cells (paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line). The effects of SOX2 knockdown on ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were also studied. The IHC and real-time PCR results showed that the difference of SOX2 expression between ovarian cancer and the adjacent non-tumorous ovarian tissues was statistically significant. Western blot analysis revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was inhibited in cells overexpressing SOX2. Western blot analysis showed that the SOX2 protein was overexpressed in paclitaxel-resistant cells and weakly detectable in paclitaxel-sensitive cells. SOX2 silencing significantly potentiated apoptosis induced by paclitaxel in SKOV3-TR with SOX2 knockdown compared to SKOV3-TR transfected with control small interfering RNA (siRNA). Our work indicates SOX2 will become both a rational indicator of ovarian cancer prognosis and a promising target for ovarian cancer gene therapy.

N2  -  PURPOSE: The Notch pathway plays an important role in both stem cell biology and cancer. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been reported in several human tumor types. In this report, we describe the development of an antibody, OMP-59R5 (tarextumab), which blocks both Notch2 and Notch3 signaling., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We utilized patient-derived xenograft tumors to evaluate antitumor effect of OMP-59R5. Immunohistochemistry, RNA microarray, real-time PCR, and in vivo serial transplantation assays were employed to investigate the mechanisms of action and pharmacodynamic readouts., RESULTS: We found that anti-Notch2/3, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents was efficacious in a broad spectrum of epithelial tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Notably, the sensitivity of anti-Notch2/3 in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic tumors was associated with higher levels of Notch3 gene expression. The antitumor effect of anti-Notch2/3 in combination with gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was greater than the combination effect with gemcitabine alone. OMP-59R5 inhibits both human and mouse Notch2 and Notch3 function and its antitumor activity was characterized by a dual mechanism of action in both tumor and stromal/vascular cells in xenograft experiments. In tumor cells, anti-Notch2/3 inhibited expression of Notch target genes and reduced tumor-initiating cell frequency. In the tumor stroma, OMP-59R5 consistently inhibited the expression of Notch3, HeyL, and Rgs5, characteristic of affecting pericyte function in tumor vasculature., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that blockade of Notch2/3 signaling with this cross-reactive antagonist antibody may be an effective strategy for treatment of a variety of tumor types.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a type of molecular chaperone. It is a possible candidate protein that contributes to development of drug resistance. We first examined the involvement of GRP78 in chemotherapy-resistance in human ovarian cancer cell., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of GRP78 mRNA and protein were examined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively, in human ovarian cancer cells line (HO-8910). Sensitivity of HO-8910 to paclitaxel was determined with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). Suppression of GRP78 expression was performed using specific small-interfering RNA (siRNA) in HO-8910 cells, and cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 15.0 statistical package., RESULTS: HO-8910 cells, with high basal levels of GRP78, exhibited low sensitivity to paclitaxel. The mRNA and protein levels of GRP78 were dramatically decreased at 24h, 48h and 72h after transfection and the sensitivity to paclitaxel was increased when the GRP78 gene was disturbed by specific siRNA transfection., CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that high GRP78 expression might be one of the molecular mechanisms causing resistance to paclitaxel, and therefore siRNA of GRP78 may be useful in tumor-specific gene therapy for ovarian cancer.

N2  -  A majority of high-grade (HG) serous ovarian cancer (SOC) patients develop resistant disease despite high initial response rates to platinum/paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. We identified shed/secreted proteins in preclinical models of paclitaxel-resistant human HGSOC models and correlated these candidate proteins with patient outcomes using public data from HGSOC patients. Proteomic analyses of a HGSOC cell line secretome was compared to those from a syngeneic paclitaxel-resistant variant and from a line established from an intrinsically chemorefractory HGSOC patient. Associations between the identified candidate proteins and patient outcome were assessed in a discovery cohort of 545 patients and two validation cohorts totaling 795 independent SOC patients. Among the 81 differentially abundant proteins identified (q < 0.05) from paclitaxel-sensitive vs -resistant HGSOC cell secretomes, AKAP12 was verified to be elevated in all models of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC. Furthermore, elevated AKAP12 transcript expression was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival. Associations with outcome were observed in three independent cohorts and remained significant after adjusted multivariate modeling. We further provide evidence to support that differential gene methylation status is associated with elevated expression of AKAP12 in taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer patient subsets. Elevated expression and shedding/secretion of AKAP12 is characteristic of paclitaxel-resistant HGSOC cells, and elevated AKAP12 transcript expression is a poor prognostic and predictive marker for progression-free and overall survival in SOC patients.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Zoledronic acid is being increasingly recognized for its antitumor properties, but the underlying functions are not well understood. In this study, we hypothesized that zoledronic acid inhibits ovarian cancer angiogenesis preventing Rac1 activation., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The biologic effects of zoledronic acid were examined using a series of in vitro [cell invasion, cytokine production, Rac1 activation, reverse-phase protein array, and in vivo (orthotopic mouse models)] experiments., RESULTS: There was significant inhibition of ovarian cancer (HeyA8-MDR and OVCAR-5) cell invasion as well as reduced production of proangiogenic cytokines in response to zoledronic acid treatment. Furthermore, zoledronic acid inactivated Rac1 and decreased the levels of Pak1/p38/matrix metalloproteinase-2 in ovarian cancer cells. In vivo, zoledronic acid reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation and inactivated Rac1 in both HeyA8-MDR and OVCAR-5 models. These in vivo antitumor effects were enhanced in both models when zoledronic acid was combined with nab-paclitaxel., CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronic acid has robust antitumor and antiangiogenic activity and merits further clinical development as ovarian cancer treatment.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To examine the expression of heparin binding-epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB- EGF) in paclitaxel- resistant ovarian cancer and elucidate the relationship between HB-EGF and the resistance of ovarian cancer to paclitaxel., METHODS: The human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780 and the paclitaxel- resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780/Taxol were cultured in vitro. Western blot was used to dectect the expression of HB-EGF protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol groups. The A2780 cells were treated with cross- reacting material 197 (CRM197 and A2780 + CRM197 group) or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO; A2780 group), while the A2780/Taxol cells were treated with CRM197 (A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group) or DMSO (A2780/Taxol group). The effects of CRM197 on growth and proliferation was tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT) and the results were showed as absorbance (A). The effects of CRM197 on cell cycles was tested by flow cytometry, while the effects of CRM197 on apoptosis was examined by caspase- 3 activity assay and the results were showed as p- nitroaniline(pNa). In animal experiment, four groups of cells were inoculated to BALB/c nude mouse subcutaneously to observe tumor formation ability following CRM197 treatment. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the expression of HB-EGF protein in A2780 and A2780/Taxol group., RESULTS: The expression level of HB-EGF protein in A2780/Taxol group (2.11 +/- 0.41) was significantly higher than that of A2780 group (0.75 +/- 0.20; P < 0.01). The inhibition effect of CRM197 on the cell growth of A2780+CRM197 and A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was accompanied by the acceleration of CRM197 concentration(P < 0.01). When CRM197>=1 microg/ml, the inhibition effect of CRM197 on the cell growth of A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group was significantly higher than that in A2780/Taxol group(P < 0.05). In cell cycle experiment, CRM197 induced the cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in A2780+CRM197 cells[(67 +/- 4)%] compared with A2780 cells[(54 +/- 6)%; P < 0.01], while CRM197 significantly induced the cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 cells [(72 +/- 4)%] compared with A2780/Taxol cells [(24 +/- 8)%; P < 0.01]. CRM197 treatment in A2780+CRM197 group [(40 +/- 6) micromol/L] led to the acceleration of the caspase-3 activity when compared to A2780 group [(6 +/- 6) micromol/L; P < 0.01], while CRM197 treatment in A2780/Taxol+CRM197 group [(66 +/- 12) micromol/L] led to significant acceleration of the caspase-3 activity when compared to A2780 group [(9 +/- 6) micromol/L; P < 0.01]. In experiments in vivo, the expression scores of HB- EGF protein in A2780/Taxol tumors (10.8 +/- 3.3) were higher than that in A2780 tumors (5.0 +/- 2.2; P < 0.01). The tumor size and tumor weight of the A2780/Taxol + CRM197 group were both higher than those of the A2780+CRM197 group [(546 +/- 85) mm3 vs (1 355 +/- 119) mm3, (0.56 +/- 0.09)g vs(1.31 +/- 0.27)g; all P < 0.01]. The CRM197 inhibition rate of the A2780+ CRM197 and A2780/Taxol + CRM197 group were 43% and 68% respectively, showed that CRM197 significantly suppressed the growth of A2780/Taxol xenografts in vivo(P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: HB-EGF is over-expressed in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer and may be contributes to drug resistance. Inhibition of HB- EGF expression potently enhances apoptosis and inhibit the growth of paclitaxel- resistant ovarian cancer, shedding light on the HB-EGF-targeted therapy options for chemoresistant ovarian cancer patients.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Cisplatin and its platinum derivatives are first-line chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however, treatment is associated with tumor resistance and significant toxicity. Here we investigated the antitumoral activity of lipoplatin, one of the most promising liposomal platinum drug formulations under clinical investigation., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro effects of lipoplatin were tested on a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines, sensitive and resistant to cisplatin, using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell models. We evaluated in vivo the lipoplatin anticancer activity using tumor xenografts., RESULTS: Lipoplatin exhibited a potent antitumoral activity in all ovarian cancer cell lines tested, induced apoptosis, and activated caspase-9, -8, and -3, downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax. Lipoplatin inhibited thioredoxin reductase enzymatic activity and increased reactive oxygen species accumulation and reduced EGF receptor (EGFR) expression and inhibited cell invasion. Lipoplatin demonstrated a synergistic effect when used in combination with doxorubicin, widely used in relapsed ovarian cancer treatment, and with the albumin-bound paclitaxel, Abraxane. Lipoplatin decreased both ALDH and CD133 expression, markers of ovarian cancer stem cells. Multicellular aggregates/spheroids are present in ascites of patients and most contribute to the spreading to secondary sites. Lipoplatin decreased spheroids growth, vitality, and cell migration out of preformed spheroids. Finally, lipoplatin inhibited more than 90% tumor xenograft growth with minimal systemic toxicity, and after the treatment suspension, no tumor progression was observed., CONCLUSION: These preclinical data suggest that lipoplatin has potential for clinical assessment in aggressive cisplatin-resistant patients with ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX), a taxane plant product, is one of the most effective broad-spectrum anti-cancer agents and approved for the treatment of a variety of cancers including ovarian, breast, lung, head and neck as well as Kaposi's sarcoma. Poor aqueous solubility and serious side effects associated with commercial preparation of PTX (Taxol R) triggered the development of alternative PTX formulations. Over past three decades, plethora of research work has been published towards the development of cremophor free and efficient formulations. Various nanocarrier systems including nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, bioconjugates and dendrimers have been employed in order to improve PTX solubility and eliminate undesired side effects. These nanocarriers offer the advantage of high degree of encapsulation and cellular uptake, escape from elimination by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux, and can be explored for targeted drug delivery. The potential of these nanocarriers is reflected by the fact that various nanocarriers of PTX are in different stages of clinical trials and a few have already been commercialized including Abraxane R, Lipusu and Genexol PM R. This review focuses on the various challenges associated with PTX formulation development, limitations of existing formulations and novel approaches for the development of alternative formulations for PTX and also highlights the development of novel formulations in clinical settings.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality rate among gynecological malignancies due to high chemoresistance to the combination of platinum with taxane. Immunotherapy against ovarian cancer is a promising strategy to develop from animal-based cancer research. We investigated changes in the immunogenicity of paclitaxel-exposed ovarian cancer cells following exposure to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Murine ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) showed some resistance to paclitaxel, a first-line therapy for ovarian cancer. However, MOSECs pre-exposed to paclitaxel died through apoptosis after incubation with doxorubicin or cisplatin for 2 h. Injected into mice, the paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs post-treated with doxorubicin induced more MOSEC-specific CD4(+) T cells and extended survival for a greater time than MOSECs treated with paclitaxel alone; and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) expressed higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules and produced IL-12 after co-culture with paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin. We also observed that in paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs treated with doxorubicin, but not cisplatin, the expression of MyD88 and related target proteins decreased compared to paclitaxel-exposed MOSECs only, while in BMDCs co-cultured with these MOSECs the expression of myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) increased. These findings suggest that paclitaxel pre-exposed cancer cells treated with doxorubicin can induce significant apoptosis and a therapeutic antitumor immune response in advanced ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Paclitaxel, a known TLR4 ligand, leads to activation of TLR4/MyD88-dependent pathway that mediates chemoresistance and tumor progression in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Atractylenolide-I (AO-I), a novel TLR4-antagonizing agent, inhibits TLR4 signaling by interfering with the binding of LPS or paclitaxel to membrane TLR4 of human leukocytes. In this study, AO-I was found to attenuate paclitaxel-induced protein expression of IL-6, VEGF and survivin, and to enhance early apoptosis and growth inhibition in MyD88(+) EOC cells; AO-I was shown to fit into the hydrophobic pocket of human MD-2 and to partially overlap with the binding site of paclitaxel by docking simulations, suggesting that AO-I may block the MD-2-mediated TLR4/MyD88-dependent paclitaxel signaling in MyD88(+) EOC cells. Therefore, AO-I could significantly sensitize the response of MyD88(+) EOC cells to paclitaxel by blocking MD-2-mediated TLR4/MyD88 signaling, and that AO-I-paclitaxel combination could be a promising strategy for the treatment of EOC with a functional TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB pathway.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel (PTX; Taxol, Abraxane) is used in many regimens for breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and ovarian cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PTX exhibits a greater than 10-fold interpatient variability of clearance rates when patients are dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships have been elucidated from BSA-based dosing. PTX is a candidate for dose management, and studies have shown that therapeutic dose management (TDM) is feasible and may provide improved outcomes for patients undergoing treatment., METHODS: A PTX immunoassay (MyPaclitaxel) has been developed, which employs a novel PTX monoclonal antibody in a nanoparticle-based turbidimetric assay in a competitive format. Precision, accuracy, and linearity were evaluated by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute protocols at 3 laboratories on the Olympus AU400 analyzer. Method comparison was done versus a validated high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy method using samples (n = 119) collected from patients on PTX therapy., RESULTS: The assay requires 8 muL of plasma sample and can produce 400 determinations per hour. The response curve is based on a 6-point nonlinear curve fit and has a range of 0-320 ng/mL, extended to 3200 ng/mL with 10-fold autodilution. Three controls and 4 patient pools were used in precision studies. For all samples across 3 sites, repeatability coefficient of variation percentages ranged 0.9%-4.9%, and within-laboratory coefficient of variation percentages were 1.0%-4.2% with standard curve stability up to 24 days. Linearity was demonstrated over the linear range. Lower limits of detection and quantitation were 11 and 19 ng/mL, respectively. Method comparison results were analyzed by Deming regression, demonstrating a slope = 1.002 and intercept = -3.029 and an R = 0.996. The PTX samples ranged from 24 to 3164 ng/mL with a mean of 745 ng/mL., CONCLUSIONS: The analytical performance of an automated immunoassay for PTX has been validated and may serve as a useful tool for TDM of this drug.

N2  -  Sensory neuropathy is a common but difficult to quantify complication encountered during treatment of various cancers with taxane-containing regimens. Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and its nanoparticle albumin-bound formulation have been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials comparing various dose and schedules for the treatment of breast, lung, and ovarian cancers. This review highlights differences in extent of severe neuropathies encountered in such randomized trials and seeks to draw conclusions in terms of known pharmacologic factors that may lead to neuropathy. This basic knowledge provides an essential background for exploring pharmacogenomic differences among patients in relation to their susceptibility of developing severe manifestations. In addition, the differences highlighted may lead to greater insight into drug and basic host factors (such as age, sex, and ethnicity) contributing to axonal injury from taxanes.

N2  -  Taxanes are a key chemotherapy component for several malignancies, including metastatic breast cancer (MBC), ovarian cancer, and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the clinical benefit achieved with solvent-based (sb) taxanes, these agents can be associated with significant and severe toxicities. Albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane; nab R-Paclitaxel), a novel solvent-free taxane, has demonstrated higher response rates and improved tolerability when compared with solvent-based formulations in patients with advanced MBC and NSCLC. The technology used to create nab-paclitaxel utilizes albumin to deliver paclitaxel, resulting in an advantageous pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. This review discusses the proposed mechanism of delivery of nab-paclitaxel, including an examination into a hypothesized greater ability to leverage albumin-based transport relative to sb-paclitaxel. An advantageous PK profile and the more efficient use of albumin-based transport may contribute to the preclinical finding that nab-paclitaxel achieves a 33% higher tumor uptake relative to sb-paclitaxel. Another possible contributing factor to the tumor accumulation of nab-paclitaxel is the binding of albumin to secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), although the data supporting this relationship between SPARC and nab-paclitaxel remain largely correlative at this point. Recent data also suggest that nab-paclitaxel may enhance tumor accumulation of gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer treated with both agents. Additionally, a possible mechanistic synergy between nab-paclitaxel and capecitabine has been cited as the rationale to combine the two agents for MBC treatment. Thus, nab-paclitaxel appears to interact with tumors in a number of interesting, but not fully understood, ways. Continued preclinical and clinical research across a range of tumor types is warranted to answer the questions that remain on the mechanisms of delivery and antitumor activity of nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) stands as the poorest prognostic tumor of the digestive tract, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. Therapeutic options for unresectable PDAC are extremely limited and there is a pressing need for expanded therapeutic approaches to improve current options available with gemcitabine-based regimens. With PDAC displaying one of the most prominent desmoplastic stromal reactions of all carcinomas, recent research has focused on the microenvironment surrounding PDAC cells. Secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC), which is overexpressed in PDAC, may display tumor suppressor functions in several cancers (e.g., in colorectal, ovarian, prostate cancers, and acute myelogenous leukemia) but also appears to be overexpressed in other tumor types (e.g., breast cancer, melanoma, and glioblastoma). The apparent contradictory functions of SPARC may yield inhibition of angiogenesis via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor, while promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and invasion through matrix metalloprotease expression. This feature is of particular interest in PDAC where SPARC overexpression in the stroma stands along with inhibition of angiogenesis and promotion of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Several therapeutic strategies to deplete stromal tissue have been developed. In this review, we focused on key preclinical and clinical data describing the role of SPARC in PDAC biology, the properties, and mechanisms of delivery of drugs that interact with SPARC and discuss the proof-of-concept clinical trials using nab-paclitaxel.

N2  -  In recent years, drug delivery systems (DDS) have been developed, along with anticancer agents for those systems based on the concept of achieving a better clinical response and tolerability. Several clinical trials have shown that these drugs have better clinical effects in the treatment of many cancers, leading to their expanded indications. Liposomal doxorubicin is one DDS agent used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian cancer in Japan. In addition to those two indications, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved this drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2007. Another DDS agent approved in Japan is nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, which has been used in the treatment of breast cancer. Most recently, this drug has been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S.A. Although these DDS agents appear to be less toxic than conventional drugs, DDS-specific side effects such as various skin reactions, hypersensitivity reaction, and peripheral neuropathy sometimes occur. Therefore, medical staff must understand DDS anticancer agents fully, including characteristic side effects, to achieve the desired clinical outcomes.

N2  -  Nanoparticle-albumin bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) represents an innovative taxane-containing formulation lacking any critical solvents with minimal risks for any hypersensitivity reactions as well as perspectives for dose escalation as a consequence. Preclinical data indicated an increase of drug accumulation in tumor tissues via nab-paclitaxel administration which appears to be related to direct interaction with albumin-binding proteins including stromal SPARC. Phase III study results revealed clinically relevant advantages regarding efficacy and tolerability associated with nab-paclitaxel compared to conventional docetaxel and paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Further experience may encourage its use in other tumor entities including NSCLC, ovarian and pancreatic carcinoma as well as melanoma. As a consequence, the development of algorithms is ongoing in order to be able to select patients in more detail who will particularly benefit from nab-paclitaxel treatment.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: We examined the safety and efficacy of combining bevacizumab with albumin-bound (ab-) paclitaxel to treat patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant primary epithelial ovarian or peritoneal carcinoma., METHODS: Patients had measurable disease per RECIST guidelines, progressing within 6 months after a prior course of platinum-based treatment. Patients received ab-paclitaxel 100mg/m(2) given by intravenous infusion over 30 min on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle with bevacizumab 10mg/kg given on days 1 and 15., RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with an average 1.8 prior lines of treatment participated. The overall response rate was 50% (24/48) (95% CI, 34.8% - 65.1%), with 4 complete and 20 partial responses. Fourteen patients (29%) had stable disease, whereas eight (17%) had progressive disease, and two (4%) were not evaluable. Patients received a median of 6 treatment cycles (range, 1 - 31 cycles). The median progression-free survival was 8.08 months (95% CI, 5.78 - 10.15 months); 6 month progression-free rate was 62.5% (95% CI, 47.8%-77.2%); median overall survival was 17.15 months (95% CI, 13.57 - 23.82 months). Grade 3-4 adverse events included gastrointestinal disorders (18.8%), neutropenia (8.3%), and hypertension (6.3%)., CONCLUSIONS: Ab-paclitaxel with bevacizumab clearly demonstrates antitumor activity and manageable toxicity profile in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma. This regimen should be evaluated in a larger randomized trial. Copyright © 2012. Published by Elsevier Inc.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: An increasing research interest has been directed toward nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for their advantages. The appropriate amalgamation of pH sensitivity and tumor targeting is a promising strategy to fabricate drug delivery systems with high efficiency, high selectivity and low toxicity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel pH sensitive Cremophor-free paclitaxel formulation, Nanoxel(TM), was developed in which the drug is delivered as nanomicelles using a polymeric carrier that specifically targets tumors. The efficiency and mechanism of intracellular paclitaxel delivery by Nanoxel(TM) was compared with two other commercially available paclitaxel formulations: Abraxane(TM) and Intaxel(TM), using different cell lines representing target cancers [breast, ovary and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)] by transmission electron microscopy and quantitative intracellular paclitaxel measurements by high performance liquid chromatography., RESULTS: The data obtained from the present study revealed that the uptake of nanoparticle-based formulations Nanoxel(TM) and Abraxane(TM) is mediated by the process of endocytosis and the uptake of paclitaxel was remarkably superior to Intaxel(TM) in all cell lines tested. Moreover, the intracellular uptake of paclitaxel in Nanoxel(TM)- and Abraxane(TM)-treated groups was comparable. Hence, the nanoparticle-based formulations of paclitaxel (Nanoxel(TM) and Abraxane(TM)) are endowed with higher efficiency to deliver the drug to target cells as compared to the conventional Cremophor-based formulation., CONCLUSION: Nanoxel(TM) appears to be of great promise in tumor targeting and may provide an advantage for paclitaxel delivery into cancer cells.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynaecological cancer. The main reason for the high mortality among ovarian cancer patients is the development of drug resistance. The expression of collagen genes by cancer cells can increase drug resistance by inhibiting the penetration of the drug into the cancer tissue as well as increase apoptosis resistance. In this study, we present data that shows differential expression levels of collagen genes and proteins in cisplatin- (CIS), paclitaxel- (PAC), doxorubicin- (DOX), topotecan- (TOP), vincristine- (VIN) and methotrexate- (MTX) resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions were performed to determine the mRNA levels. Protein expression was detected using Western blot and immunocytochemistry assays. In the drug resistant cell lines, we observed the upregulation of eight collagen genes at the mRNA level and based on these expression levels, we divided the collagen genes into the following three groups: 1. Genes with less than a 50-fold increase in expression: COL1A1, COL5A2, COL12A1 and COL17A1. 2. Genes with greater than a 50-fold increase in expression: COL1A2, COL15A1 and COL21A1. 3. Gene with a very high level of expression: COL3A1. Expression of collagen (COL) proteins from groups 2 and 3 were also confirmed using immunocytochemistry. Western blot analysis showed very high expression levels of COL3A1 protein, and immunocytochemistry analysis showed the presence of extracellular COL3A1 in the W1TR cell line. The cells mainly responsible for the extracellular COL3A1 production are aldehyde dehydrogenase-1A1 (ALDH1A1) positive cells. All correlations between the types of cytostatic drugs and the expression levels of different COL genes were studied, and our results suggest that the expression of fibrillar collagens may be involved in the TOP and PAC resistance of the ovarian cancer cells. The expression pattern of COL genes provide a preliminary view into the role of these proteins in cytostatic drug resistance of cancer cells. The exact role of these COL genes in drug resistance requires further investigation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a member of the hydroxamic acid class of the newly developed histone deacetylase inhibitors. Recently, Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has attracted increasing attention because of its antitumor activity and synergistic effects in combination with a variety of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. Paclitaxel (PTX), is a natural anticancer drugs; however, resistance to paclitaxel has become a major challenge to the efficacy of this agent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined application of these two drugs on the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cell line., METHODS: In the present study, the effects of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or/and paclitaxel on OC3/P cells cultured in vitro were analyzed in terms of cell viability, migration, cell-cycle progression and apoptosis by CCK-8, wound healing and flow cytometry assays. Changes in cell ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The expression of genes and proteins related to proliferation, apoptosis and drug resistance were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses., RESULTS: There was no cross-resistance of the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cells to Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid combined with paclitaxel significantly inhibited cell growth and reduced the migration of OC3/P cells compared with the effects of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or paclitaxel alone. Q-PCR showed the combination of Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and paclitaxel reduced intracellular bcl-2 and c-myc gene expression and increased bax gene expression more distinctly than the application of SAHA or paclitaxel alone. Moreover, the level of mdr1 gene expression in cells treated with Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid was lower than that of the control group (P <0.05). Western blot analysis showed that Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid alone or in combination with paclitaxel enhanced caspase-3 protein expression and degraded ID1 protein expression in OC3/P cells., CONCLUSION: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid inhibited the growth of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer OC3/P cells and reduced migration by the induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. These observations indicate the possible synergistic antitumor effects of sequential Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and paclitaxel treatment.

N2  -  Background. Ovarian cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women and causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive cancer. Albumin-bound paclitaxel is known to increase intratumoral concentration of the paclitaxel by a receptor-mediated transport process across the endothelial cell wall, thereby breaching the blood/tumor interface. We present below three cases in which nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy has been used in different settings for patients with ovarian cancer. Case Presentation. In the first case nab-paclitaxel was used along with carboplatin in adjuvant setting, in the second case, nab-paclitaxel was used along with carboplatin and bevacizumab as second line chemotherapy in a relapsed ovarian cancer case, and the third case delineates the use of nab-paclitaxel along with cisplatin as third line chemotherapy. Conclusion . In all the three scenarios, patients tolerated the chemotherapy well, as well as responding well to nab-paclitaxel based chemotherapy. The patients are currently on long-term follow-up and have been having an uneventful postchemotherapy.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs ever developed and is active against a broad range of cancers, such as lung, ovarian, and breast cancers. Due to its low water solubility, paclitaxel is formulated in a mixture of Cremophor EL and dehydrated ethanol (50:50, v/v) a combination known as Taxol. However, Taxol has some severe side effects related to Cremophor EL and ethanol. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative Taxol formulations. The encapsulation of paclitaxel in biodegradable and non-toxic nano-delivery systems can protect the drug from degradation during circulation and in-turn protect the body from toxic side effects of the drug thereby lowering its toxicity, increasing its circulation half-life, exhibiting improved pharmacokinetic profiles, and demonstrating better patient compliance. Also, nanoparticle-based delivery systems can take advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for passive tumor targeting, therefore, they are promising carriers to improve the therapeutic index and decrease the side effects of paclitaxel. To date, paclitaxel albumin-bound nanoparticles (Abraxane R) have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, there are a number of novel paclitaxel nanoparticle formulations in clinical trials. In this comprehensive review, several types of developed paclitaxel nano-delivery systems will be covered and discussed, such as polymeric nanoparticles, lipid-based formulations, polymer conjugates, inorganic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, nanocrystals, and cyclodextrin nanoparticles.

N2  -  Exogenous cell-permeable C6 ceramide has been demonstrated to act synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel, cisplatin, doxorubicin and the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, to induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells. We previously demonstrated that C6 ceramide and paclitaxel function synergistically to induce ovarian cancer cell death via modulation of the PI3/AKT cell survival pathway. In the present study, the entry pattern of C6 ceramide into ovarian cancer cells was investigated using fluorescent short chain C6-NBD sphingomyelin (C6-NBD). Confocal microscopy revealed that C6-NBD enters the cells in a polarized pattern, characterized by marked signals at one cellular end, representing a likely mitosis initiation site. Pretreatment of the cells with filipin, an inhibitor of the lipid raft/caveolae endocytosis pathway, decreases C6-NBD entry into the cells. A pretreatment with the water channel inhibitor, CuSO4, was also found to reduce the entry of C6-NBD. Notably, the pretreatment with paclitaxel was shown to disrupt the polarized entry of C6-NBD into the cells, resulting in an even distribution of C6-NBD in the cytoplasm. In addition, the pretreatment of the cells with paclitaxel destabilized the cytoskeletal proteins, releasing an increased number of short tubulin fragments. The results of the present study indicate that C6 ceramide preferentially enters the cells via a predetermined initiation site of mitosis. In addition to diffusion, short chain C6 ceramide may also enter cells via water channels and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Paclitaxel disrupts the cell cytoskeleton and induces an even distribution of C6 ceramide in the cytoplasm resulting in synergistic ovarian cancer cell death.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of RNA interference with transferred pshRNA/PHB on the biological characteristics of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines., METHODS: Western blot and real time-PCR were used to assay the expression of PHB protein and mRNA in SKOV3/Taxol-25 and SKOV3 cell lines. The SKOV3/Taxol-25 cell lines were transiently transfected by 3 target-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) interference fragments with fluorescent protein named the pshRNA427/PHB1, pshRNA248/PHB2, and pshRNA136/PHB3. The empty plasmid transfection via vehicle Lipofectamine2000 served as a negative control. The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA were detected by Western blot and real time-PCR after the transfection for 48 h. The silence effect of PHB1 and PHB3 groups was obvious. PHB1, PHB3, and the negative control groups were used for the following experiments. MTT and flow cytometry assay were used to test the cell proliferation, IC50 of paclitaxel, and cell apoptosis in the 3 groups., RESULTS: The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA (2(-DELTADELTACt)) were significantly higher in SKOV3/Taxol-25 cell line than those in SKOV3 cell line (P<0.05). The expression levels of PHB protein and mRNA were significantly lower in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups than those in the negative control group (P<0.05). The cell proliferations in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups were obviously slower than those in the negative control group after transfection for 48 h and 72 h (P<0.05). The IC50 of paclitaxel in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups significantly decreased after transfection for 72 h compared with the negative control group(P<0.05). The cell apoptotic rate in the PHB1 and PHB3 groups significantly increased after transfection for 48 h compared with the negative control group (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: The shRNA/PHB can effectively suppress the expression of PHB gene in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. The cell proliferation in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines with removed PHB gene is significantly reduced. The apoptotic rate and the paclitaxel sensitivity of resistant cell lines with removed PHB gene are significantly increased. PHB gene is related to paclitaxel-resistance and interfering PHB gene expression may reduce paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether silence of PKC-alpha expression by small interference RNA (siRNA) might regulate MDR1 expression and reverse chemoresistance of ovarian cancer., METHODS: We measured gene and protein expression of MDR1 and PKC-alpha in ovarian cancer cells and assessed their correlation with cell drug resistance. We also examined whether blocking PKC-alpha by RNA interference (RNAi) affected MDR1 expression and reversed drug resistance in drug sensitivity tests., RESULTS: The drug resistance cell lines, OV1228/DDP and OV1228/Taxol, had higher gene and protein expression of MDR1 and PKC-alpha than their counterpart sensitive cell line, OV1228. SiRNA depressed PKC-alpha gene protein expression, as well as MDR1 and protein expression and improved the drug sensitivity in OV1228/DDP and OV1228/Taxol cells., CONCLUSION: These results indicated that decreasing PKC-alpha expression with siRNA might be an effective method to improve drug sensitivity in drug resistant cells with elevated levels of PKC-alpha and MDR1. A new siRNA-based therapeutic strategy targeting PKC-alpha gene could be designed to overcome the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer.

N2  -  AIM: Metformin plays an important role in the inhibition of cancer cell growth and prolongs remission durations. It reverses progestin-resistance in endometrial cancer cells by downregulating glyoxalase I (GloI) expression. This study aimed to investigate the effect of metformin on endometrial cancer cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms., MATERIAL AND METHODS: MTT assay was performed to determine the rate of cell death after cisplatin and paclitaxel with or without metformin. Western blot was carried out to analyze GloI expression. SiRNA-targeting of GloI was used to knockdown GloI expression before further treatment with chemotherapeutic agents to examine the effect of GloI downregulation on chemotherapy-induced cell killing. In addition, plasmid transfection was used to overexpress GloI and determine whether high GloI levels blocked metformin-enhanced cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. PCR was used to analyze the efficiency of RNA interference and plasmid transfection., RESULTS: The addition of metformin enhanced the sensitivity of endometrial cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel, which was associated with reduced levels of GloI expression. Moreover, low-dose chemotherapeutic drugs alone could not significantly reduce GloI expression, whereas the addition of metformin potently downregulated GloI protein levels. Cisplatin and paclitaxel markedly inhibited the proliferative ability of GloI-depleted endometrial cancer cells. However, the overexpression of GloI abolished the effect of metformin-enhanced cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs., CONCLUSION: Metformin enhances the rate of cell-killing induced by chemotherapeutic agents by repressing GloI expression.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Epithelial junctions between tumor cells inhibit the penetration of anticancer drugs into tumors. We previously reported on recombinant adenovirus serotype 3-derived protein (JO-1), which triggers transient opening of intercellular junctions in epithelial tumors through binding to desmoglein 2 (DSG2), and enhances the antitumor effects of several therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether JO-1 cotherapy can also improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of intravenous application of JO-1 in combination with several chemotherapy drugs, including paclitaxel/Taxol, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel/Abraxane, liposomal doxorubicin/Doxil, and irinotecan/Camptosar, was tested in xenograft models for breast, colon, ovarian, gastric and lung cancer. Because JO-1 does not bind to mouse cells, for safety studies with JO-1, we also used human DSG2 (hDSG2) transgenic mice with tumors that overexpressed hDSG2., RESULTS: JO-1 increased the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, and in several models overcame drug resistance. JO-1 treatment also allowed for the reduction of drug doses required to achieve antitumor effects. Importantly, JO-1 coadmininstration protected normal tissues, including bone marrow and intestinal epithelium, against toxic effects that are normally associated with chemotherapeutic agents. Using the hDSG2-transgenic mouse model, we showed that JO-1 predominantly accumulates in tumors. Except for a mild, transient diarrhea, intravenous injection of JO-1 (2 mg/kg) had no critical side effects on other tissues or hematologic parameters in hDSG2-transgenic mice., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest that JO-1 cotherapy has the potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer chemotherapy.

N2  -  In this paper, an overview of recent advances of paclitaxel formulations based on nanosystems is provided. Paclitaxel is very effective in the treatment of various cancers especially ovarian and breast cancer, but it demonstrates poor aqueous solubility, which results in the difficulty challenging the development of paclitaxel parenteral formulations, so its clinical application is greatly restricted. The conventional paclitaxel formulation uses Cremophor EL and ethanol to solubilize paclitaxel, which could cause severe side effects. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in the field of antitumor research, and paclitaxel is no exception. In recent decades, a series of novel formulations of paclitaxel based on nanotechnology have been developed, including albumin-bound paclitaxel, polymeric micelle-formulated paclitaxel, polymer-paclitaxel conjugates, liposome encapsulated paclitaxel etc. The common advantage shared with these novel injectable formulations is that they are developed based on nanotechnology and Cremophor EL-free. In addition, these nanoformulations can significantly reduce toxicities of paclitaxel and greatly promote its antitumor efficiency.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol R), a drug used to treat solid tumors of the breast, ovary and lung, stabilizes microtubules and arrests cells in G(2)/M of the cell cycle. Using two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (DIGE), we examined the proteomic response of a human HL-60 promyeloid leukemic cell line to paclitaxel. Our intention was to compare the effects of paclitaxel to those of a new-generation microtubule-stabilizing agent, peloruside A, investigated in an earlier study. In response to 100 nM paclitaxel treatment for 24 h, 21 identified proteins changed in abundance, with 13 increases and 8 decreases. In addition, 21 other unidentified proteins were also changed by treatment with paclitaxel. Using Western blotting, the transcription factor c-Myc was shown to be reduced in abundance by both drugs. Our results showed both differences and similarities at the single protein level between paclitaxel and peloruside A, although the same general classes of proteins: cytoskeletal, nucleic acid binding, stress, and apoptotic proteins, changed following exposure. The proteomic response to paclitaxel was more extensive than the response to an equipotent dose of peloruside A.

N2  -  Paclitaxel is one of the most widely used and effective antineoplastic agents derived from natural sources. It has a wide spectrum of antitumor activity, particularly against ovarian cancer, breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, head and neck tumors, Kaposi's sarcoma, and urologic malignancies. It is a highly lipophilic compound with a log P value of 3.96 and very poor aqueous solubility of less than 0.01 mg/mL. In addition, the compound lacks functional groups that are ionizable which could potentially lead to an increase in its solubility with the alteration in pH. Therefore, the delivery of paclitaxel is associated with substantial challenges. Until the introduction of Abraxane, only commercial formulation was solution of paclitaxel in cremophor, which caused severe side effects. However, in recent years, a number of approaches have been reported to solubilize paclitaxel using cosolvents and inclusion complexes. In addition, innovative approaches have been reported for passive targeting of tumors using nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, liposomes, emulsions, micelles, implants, pastes and gels. All approaches for delivery of improved therapeutic outcome have been discussed in this paper.

N2  -  Paclitaxel has been widely used as an anti-mitotic agent in chemotherapy for a variety of cancers and adds substantial efficacy as the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen for ovarian cancers. However, the frequent occurrence of paclitaxel resistance limits its function in long-term management. Despite abundant clinical and cellular demonstration of paclitaxel resistant tumors, the molecular mechanisms leading to paclitaxel resistance are poorly understood. Using genomic approaches, we have previously identified an association between a BTB/POZ gene, Nac1, and paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. The experiments presented here have applied multiple quantitative proteomic methods to identify protein changes associated with paclitaxel resistance and Nac1 function. The SKOV-3 ovarian serous carcinoma cell line, which has inducible expression of dominant negative Nac1, was used to determine the paclitaxel treatment associated changes in the presence and absence of functional Nac1. Quantitative proteomic analyses were performed using iTRAQ labeling and mass spectrometry. Two label-free quantitative proteomic methods: LC-MS and spectral count were used to increase confidence of proteomic quantification. A total of 1371 proteins were quantified by at least one of the quantitative proteomic methods. Candidate proteins related to paclitaxel and NAC1 function were identified in this study. Go analysis of the protein changes identified upon paclitaxel resistance revealed that cell component enrichment related to mitochondria. Moreover, tubulin and mitochondrial proteins were the major cellular components with changes associated with paclitaxel treatment. This suggests that mitochondria may play a role in paclitaxel resistance.

N2  -  Taxanes are chemotherapeutic agents with a large spectrum of antitumor activity when used as monotherapy or in combination regimens. Paclitaxel and docetaxel have poor solubility and require a complex solvent system for their commercial formulation, Cremophor EL(R) (CrEL) and Tween 80(R) respectively. Both these biological surfactants have recently been implicated as contributing not only to the hypersensitivity reactions, but also to the degree of peripheral neurotoxicity and myelosuppression, and may antagonize the cytotoxicity. Nab-paclitaxel, or nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (ABI-007; Abraxane(R)), is a novel formulation of paclitaxel that does not employ the CrEL solvent system. Nab-paclitaxel demonstrates greater efficacy and a favorable safety profile compared with standard paclitaxel in patients with advanced disease (breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer). Clinical studies in breast cancer have shown that nab-paclitaxel is significantly more effective than standard paclitaxel in terms of overall objective response rate (ORR) and time to progression. Nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, capecitabine or bevacizumab has been shown to be very active in patients with advanced breast cancer. An economic analysis showed that nab-paclitaxel would be an economically reasonable alternative to docetaxel or standard paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer. Favorable tumor ORR and manageable toxicities have been reported for nab-paclitaxel as monotherapy or in combination treatment in advanced breast cancer.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Taxol binds to the cellular microtubules and suppresses their dynamic instability. Development of tumor cell resistance to taxol is typically associated with increased expression of the drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein and/or alterations in the microtubules. Recently, changes in the dynamic instability of the microtubules have also been associated with development of taxol resistance in a lung cancer cell line. We have established a 250-fold taxol-resistant human ovarian carcinoma subline (2008/13/4) that does not display the typical alterations associated with development of drug resistance., RESULTS: Utilizing the mRNA differential display technique, we observed increased expression of an alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Galphai1, in the taxol-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell lines compared to the parental 2008 cells. Several isoforms of the alpha-subunit of the G protein have been identified and the Galphai (inhibitory) are so named because they inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase leading to inactivation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. In addition, Galphai1 is also known to bind to microtubules and activates their GTPase activity and thus induces depolymerization of the microtubules. In the present study we demonstrate that the intracellular level of cAMP and the PKA activity were higher in the taxol-resistant 2008/13/4 and the 2008/17/4 cells despite the increased expression of Galphai1 in these cells. Moreover, Galphai1 was found to be localized not on the cell membrane, but in intracellular compartments in both the taxol-sensitive and -resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. Interestingly, increased association of the Galphai1 protein and the microtubules in the taxol-resistant cells compared to the parental 2008 cells was observed, both prior to and after treatment of these cells with taxol., CONCLUSION: Based on the opposing effects of taxol and the Galphai1 protein on the microtubule dynamic instability (taxol suppresses microtubule dynamic instability whilst the Galphai1 protein inhibits the suppression) our results indicate the operation of a novel pathway that would enable the cells to escape the cytotoxic effects of taxol.

N2  -  Nanoxel-PM TM, docetaxel-loaded methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(d,l-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA) micellar formulation was prepared in an effort to develop alternative, less toxic and efficacious Tween 80-free docetaxel formulation, and its pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and toxicity were evaluated in comparison with Taxotere R in preclinical studies. The mean diameter of the Nanoxel-PM TM was 10-50 nm and the polydispersity of samples exhibited a narrow size distribution and monodisperse unimodal pattern. Pharmacokinetic study in mice, rats and beagle dogs revealed that Nanoxel-PM TM exhibited similar pharmacokinetic profiles (C(max), AUC, t(1/2), CL, V(ss)) to Taxotere, and the relative mean AUC(t) and C(max) of Nanoxel-PM TM to Taxotere R were within 80-120%. Furthermore, excretion study in rats demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference in the amount excreted in feces or urine as an unmetabolized docetaxel between Nanoxel-PM TM and Taxotere R. Its pharmacokinetic bioequivalence resulted in comparable anti-tumor efficacy to Taxotere R in human lung cancer xenografts H-460 in nude mice as well as in lung, ovary and breast cancer cell lines. Several animal toxicity studies on Nanoxel-PM TM compared with Taxotere R were carried out. In single dose rat and dog model and repeated dose mouse model, both Nanoxel-PM TM and Taxotere R exhibited similar toxic effects on hematology and body weight gain. On the other hand, vehicle related hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retentions were not observed when Nanoxel-PM TM was administered, unlike Taxotere R, in the beagle dog study. Based on these results, it is expected that Nanoxel-PM TM can reduce side effects of hypersensitivity reactions and fluid retention while retaining antitumor efficacy in cancer patients. Currently, Nanoxel-PM TM is under evaluation for bioequivalence with Taxotere R in a multi-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Nab-paclitaxel is a novel Cremophor R-free nanoparticle of albumin-stabilized paclitaxel, which has favorable efficacy and toxicity characteristics relative to other solvent-based taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel., METHODS: Eligible patients had platinum- and taxane-resistant ovarian cancer, defined by persistent or progressive disease following primary chemotherapy (n = 5) or recurrence within 6 months of treatment completion (n = 42). All patients had measurable disease, no prior therapy for recurrent disease and Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of <= 2. Treatment was nab-paclitaxel, 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, and 15 on a 28-day schedule. The primary endpoint was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0 response rate, evaluated in a 2-stage design (with power of 0.90 for a RR of 25% and with alpha of 0.05 for RR of 10%)., RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled of which 47 were evaluable; median time from frontline therapy completion to registration was 21 days. Patient demographics include median age: 59 (34-78) years, serous histology: 72%, and high-grade: 81%., EFFICACY: one complete and 10 partial responses were confirmed (23%); 17 patients (36%) had stable disease. The median progression-free survival was 4.5 months (95% CI: 2.2-6.7); overall survival was 17.4 months (95% CI: 13.2-20.8). Seventeen patients (36%) had PFS > 6 months., TOXICITY: there were no grade 4 events; grade 3 events were neutropenia (6), anemia (3), GI (2), metabolic (2), pain (2), and leukopenia (1); neurosensory toxicity was observed as grade 2:5, grade 3:1., CONCLUSIONS: Nab-paclitaxel has noteworthy single-agent activity and is tolerable in this cohort of refractory ovarian cancer patients previously treated with paclitaxel.

N2  -  Multi-drug resistant (MDR) cancer is a significant clinical obstacle and is often implicated in cases of recurrent, nonresponsive disease. Targeted nanoparticles were made by synthesizing a poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)/poly(ethylene glycol)/epidermal growth factor receptor targeting peptide (PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide) construct for incorporation in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles. MDR was induced in a panel of nine human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines using hypoxia. EGFR-targeted polymer blend nanoparticles were shown to actively target EGFR overexpressing cell lines, especially upon induction of hypoxia. The nanoparticles were capable of sustained drug release. Combination therapy with lonidamine and paclitaxel significantly improved the therapeutic index of both drugs. Treatment with a nanoparticle dose of 1 muM paclitaxel/10 muM lonidamine resulted in less than 10% cell viability for all hypoxic/MDR cell lines and less than 5% cell viability for all normoxic cell lines. Comparatively, treatment with 1 muM paclitaxel alone was the approximate IC50 value of the MDR cells while treatment with lonidamine alone had very little effect. The PLGA/PEG/EGFR-peptide delivery system actively targets a MDR cell by exploiting the expression of EGFR. This system treats MDR by inhibiting the Warburg effect and promoting mitochondrial binding of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (lonidamine), while hyperstabilizing microtubules (paclitaxel). This nanocarrier system actively targets a MDR associated phenotype (EGFR receptor overexpression), further enhancing the therapeutic index of both drugs and potentiating the use of lonidamine/paclitaxel combination therapy in the treatment of MDR cancer.

N2  -  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed in women. Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most active and widely used chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of both early-stage and advanced breast cancer. In the past decade, novel formulations of these cytotoxic agents have been developed to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity. nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free, albumin-bound 130-nm particle form of paclitaxel (Abraxane, Abraxis Bioscience, CA, USA), which was developed to avoid toxicities associated with the Cremophor vehicle used in solvent-based paclitaxel. In a Phase III study, nab-paclitaxel demonstrated higher response rates, a better safety profile compared with conventional paclitaxel, and improved survival in patients receiving it as second-line therapy. Based on this pivotal trial, nab-paclitaxel is now approved in the USA for treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant therapy where prior therapy included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated. Recently, several Phase II studies have suggested a role for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination with other agents for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Studies are ongoing to explore the use of nab-paclitaxel in other solid tumors such as non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and malignant melanoma.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To study the proteins related to paclitaxel-resistant of ovarian cancer cell line., METHODS: The total proteins of paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive human ovarian cancer cell lines were separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). The differentially expressed proteins were analyzed using image analysis software. The differential proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Western blot was used to determine the differential expression levels of the 2 proteins., RESULTS: Forty differentially expressed proteins were found by image analysis software, and 24 differential proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. These proteins included proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), nm23, prohibitin (PHB), annexin, alpha-enolase, heat shock protein (HSP), and so on., CONCLUSION: Twenty-four proteins in human ovarian cancer cell lines of paclitaxel-resistant and paclitaxel-sensitive are found by proteomic techniques, which may be involved in the paclitaxel-resistance of human ovarian cancer cells.

N2  -  PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to examine the role of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway in the response of ovarian cancer cells to Taxol and to evaluate the significance of this pathway in human epithelial ovarian tumors., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of Taxol treatment on AKT activation in A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells was evaluated using antibodies specific for phospho-AKT. To study the drug-resistant phenotype, we developed a Taxol-resistant cell line, HEY-T30, derived from HEY ovarian carcinoma cells. IGF2 expression was measured by real-time PCR. A type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, and IGF2 small interfering RNA were used to evaluate the effect of IGF pathway inhibition on proliferation and Taxol sensitivity. IGF2 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 115 epithelial ovarian tumors and analyzed in relation to clinical/pathologic factors using the chi(2) or Fisher's exact tests. The influence of IGF2 expression on survival was studied with Cox regression., RESULTS: Taxol-induced AKT phosphorylation required IGF1R tyrosine kinase activity and was associated with upregulation of IGF2. Resistant cells had higher IGF2 expression compared with sensitive cells, and IGF pathway inhibition restored sensitivity to Taxol. High IGF2 tumor expression correlated with advanced stage (P < 0.001) and tumor grade (P < 0.01) and reduced disease-free survival (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: IGF2 modulates Taxol resistance, and tumor IGF2 expression is a candidate prognostic biomarker in epithelial ovarian tumors. IGF pathway inhibition sensitizes drug-resistant ovarian carcinoma cells to Taxol. Such novel findings suggest that IGF2 represents a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, particularly in the setting of Taxol resistance. Copyright 2010 AACR.

N2  -  We have developed a nanocarrier drug-delivery system based on micelles formed by a new class of well-defined linear PEGylated two-arm oligomer of cholic acids in aqueous solution. By varying the length of the linear PEG chains and the configuration of cholic acid oligomer, one can easily fine-tune the physicochemical properties of the amphiphilic polymers and the resulting micelles. These include particle size, critical micelle concentration, and drug-loading capacity. High level of hydrophobic anticancer drugs such as PTX, etoposide and SN-38 can be readily loaded into such nanocarriers. The loading capacity of the nanocarrier for PTX (PTX) is extremely high (12.0mg/mL), which is equivalent to 37.5% (w/w) of the total mass of the micelle. PTX-loaded nanocarriers are much more stable than Abraxane (PTX/human serum albumin nanoaggregate) when stored in bovine serum albumin solution or dog plasma. PTX release profile from the micelles is burst-free and sustained over a period of seven days. The anti-tumor activity of PTX-loaded nanocarriers against ovarian cancer cell line in vitro, with continuous drug exposure, is similar to Taxol (formulation of PTX dissolved in Cremophor EL and ethanol) or Abraxane. Targeted drug delivery to tumor site with these novel micelles was demonstrated by near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging in nude mice bearing ovarian cancer xenograft. Furthermore, PTX-loaded nanocarriers demonstrated superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to Taxol at equivalent PTX dose in ovarian cancer xenograft model. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

N2  -  Glycosylation, one of the most common post translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, is often associated with carcinogenesis and tumor malignancy. Ovarian cancer is the sixth cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. Currently, it is treated by debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy based on paclitaxel, alone or in combination with other drugs. However, chemoresistance represents a major obstacle to positive clinical outcome. We used two approaches, Multiplexed Proteomics (MP) technology and Multilectin Affinity Chromatography (MAC) to characterize the glycoproteome of the human ovarian cancer cell line A2780 and its paclitaxel resistant counterpart A2780TC1. Furthermore proteins were separated by traditional 2DE or DIGE and identified by MS (MALDI TOF or LC MS/MS). Seventy glycoproteins were successfully identified in ovarian cancer cells and 10 were found to be differentially expressed between sensitive and resistant cell lines. We focused on four glycoproteins (tumor rejection antigen (gp96) 1, triose phosphate isomerase, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 precursor and ER-associated DNAJ) which were remarkably upregulated in A2780TC1 compared to A2780 cell line and which may represent biomarkers for paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as co-medication in the therapy of solid malignant tumors to relieve some of the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, recent studies have shown that GCs could render cancer cells more resistant to cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis, but the mechanism is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that the treatment of human ovarian cancer cell lines HO-8910 and SKOV3 with synthetic GCs dexamethasone (Dex) significantly increased their adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) and their resistance to apoptosis induced by cytotoxic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel. Dex also increased the protein levels of adhesion molecules integrins beta1, alpha 4, and alpha 5 in HO-8910 cells. The neutralizing antibody against integrin beta1 prevented Dex-induced adhesion and significantly abrogated the protective effect of Dex toward cytotoxic agents. We further found that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) alone not only increased cell adhesion and cell survival of HO-8910 cells in the presence of cisplatin, but also had synergistic pro-adhesion and pro-survival effects with Dex. Moreover, TGF-beta1-neutralizing antibody that could block TGF-beta1-induced cell adhesion and apoptosis resistance markedly abrogated the synergistic pro-adhesion and pro-survival effects of Dex and TGF-beta1. Finally, we further demonstrated that Dex could up-regulate the expression of TGF-beta receptor type II and enhance the responsiveness of cells to TGF-beta1. In conclusion, our results indicate that increased adhesion to ECM through the enhancement of integrin beta1 signaling and TGF-beta1 signaling plays an important role in chemoresistance induced by GCs in ovarian cancer cells.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Poly-(gamma-L-glutamylglutamine)-paclitaxel (PGG-PTX) is a novel polymer-based formulation of paclitaxel (PTX) in which the PTX is linked to the polymer via ester bonds. PGG-PTX is of interest because it spontaneously forms very small nanoparticles in plasma. In mouse models, PGG-PTX increased tumor exposure to PTX by 7.7-fold relative to that produced by PTX formulated in Cremophor. In this study, the efficacy of PGG-PTX was compared to that of Abraxane, an established nanoparticular formulation of PTX, in three different tumor models., METHODS: Efficacy was quantified by delay in tumor growth of NCI H460 human lung cancer, 2008 human ovarian cancer and B16 melanoma xenografts growing in athymic mice following administration of equitoxic doses of PGG-PTX and Abraxane administered on either a single dose or every 7 day schedule. Toxicity was assessed by change in total body weight., RESULTS: The efficacy and toxicity of PGG-PTX was shown to increase with dose in the H460 model. PGG-PTX was approximately 1.5-fold less potent than Abraxane. PGG-PTX produced statistically significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth than Abraxane in all three tumor models when mice were given single equitoxic doses of drug. When given every 7 days for 3 doses, PGG-PTX produced greater inhibition of tumor growth while generating much less weight loss in mice bearing H460 tumors., CONCLUSION: PGG-PTX has activity that is superior to that of Abraxane in multiple tumor models. PGG-PTX has the potential to out-perform Abraxane in enhancing the delivery of PTX tumors while at the same time further reducing the toxicity of both single dose and weekly treatment regimens.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is used in the treatment of most gynecologic malignancies. It is solubilized in Cremophor EL, a polyoxyethylated castor oil agent responsible for the high rate of paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reactions. Abraxane, a newer, Cremophor-free form of albumin bound paclitaxel has demonstrated an activity and an improved toxicity profile in breast and lung cancers., CASE REPORTS: Five patients with gynecologic cancers (2 ovarian, 2 endometrial, and 1 cervical malignancy) received Abraxane after having a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel. All five patients tolerated Abraxane well, experiencing no reactions or major side effects to the drug., DISCUSSION: Abraxane is well tolerated in women with gynecologic cancer who have experienced a paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reaction. Further studies are ongoing to determine the clinical activity of Abraxane in the treatment of these malignancies.

N2  -  Mesothelin, a secreted protein, is overexpressed in some cancers, but its exact function remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible function of mesothelin. Real-time PCR, RT (reverse transcription)-PCR, cytotoxicity assays, proliferative assays, apoptotic assays by Hoechst staining, detection of active caspases 3 and 7 by flow cytometric analysis, and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed. Cancer tissues in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer patients expressed higher levels of mesothelin as assessed using real-time PCR than paclitaxel-sensitive ovarian cancer patients (the mean crossing point value change of mesothelin was 26.9+/-0.4 in the resistant group and 34.3+/-0.7 for the sensitive group; P<0.001). Mesothelin also protected cells from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. The protein expression of Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, was significantly increased regardless of whether cells were treated with exogenous mesothelin or were mesothelin-transfectants. Furthermore, mesothelin-treated cells revealed rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 1/2 for enhancing MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activity. The anti-apoptotic ability was suppressed and the expression of Bcl-2 family in response to mesothelin was altered by inhibiting PI3K activity, but not by inhibiting MAPK activity. Thus mesothelin can inhibit paclitaxel-induced cell death mainly by involving PI3K signalling in the regulation of Bcl-2 family expression. Mesothelin is a potential target in reducing resistance to cytotoxic drugs.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most effective chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of a variety of cancers. However, it is associated with serious side effects caused by PTX itself and the Cremophor EL emulsifier. In the present study, we report the development of a well-defined amphiphilic linear-dendritic copolymer (named as telodendrimer) composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG), cholic acid (CA, a facial amphiphilic molecule) and lysine, which can form drug-loaded core/shell micelles when mixed with hydrophobic drug, such as PTX, under aqueous condition. We have used PEG(5k)-CA(8), a representive telodendrimer, to prepare paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (PTX-PEG(5k)-CA(8) NPs) with high loading capacity (7.3 mg PTX/mL) and a size of 20-60 nm. This novel nanoformulation of PTX was found to exhibit similar in vitro cytotoxic activity against ovarian cancer cells as the free drug (Taxol) or paclitaxel/human serum albumin nanoaggregate (Abraxane). The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of PTX-PEG(5k)-CA(8) NPs after single dose and five consecutive daily doses in mice were approximately 75 and 45 mg PTX/kg, respectively, which were 2.5-fold higher than those of Taxol. In both subcutaneous and orthotopic intraperitoneal murine models of ovarian cancer, PTX-PEG(5k)-CA(8) NPs achieved superior toxicity profiles and anti-tumor effects compared to Taxol and Abraxane at equivalent PTX doses, which were attributed to their preferential tumor accumulation, and deep penetration into tumor tissue, as confirmed by near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging.

N2  -  Paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizer, is an effective agent for treating cancer of the breast, ovary, head and neck, and lung. Because paclitaxel is insoluble in water, it is formulated with the micelle-forming Cremophor EL. Neurologic toxicity is well described with both the drug and this carrier, with most toxicities manifesting as peripheral neuropathy, motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and myopathy. Toxic effects on the central nervous system, such as seizures or encephalopathy, have been rarely reported; however, the seizures reported were closely related to the time of infusion. We describe a 41-year-old woman with no history of seizures who was treated with paclitaxel for breast cancer. Four days after the drug was infused, she developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure that could not be attributed to other causes. The patient was treated with phenytoin and was able to complete her adjuvant chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel without further events. Her condition was neurologically stable without phenytoin for the next 6 months. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible association (score of 3) between the delayed seizure and paclitaxel or its solvent, Cremophor EL. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for seizure activity in patients who receive paclitaxel formulated with Cremophor EL.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone for treatment of ovarian cancer, some patients are resistant to the treatment and will therefore not benefit from the standard platinum-based chemotherapy. Preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential use of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme (ERCC1) as a molecular predictor of clinical resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme is a key enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair pathway which is involved in the DNA repair mechanisms in tumor cells damaged by treatment with platinum agents. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate if immunohistochemical expression of ERCC1 protein was associated with resistance to standard combination carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients., METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 101 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer were used for immunohistochemical staining for the ERCC1 protein. All patients received carboplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy., RESULTS: Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme protein overexpression was found in 13.9% of the tumors. Platinum resistance was found in 75% of the tumors with positive ERCC1 protein expression compared with 27% among the patients with negative tumor staining for ERCC1 (P = 0.0013). These findings translated into a significant difference in progression-free survival in both univariate (P = 0.0012) and in multivariate analysis (P = 0.006)., CONCLUSIONS: The data presented suggest a positive association between positive ERCC1 protein expression and clinical resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer have limited therapeutic options. There are no reports of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive disease. We report efficacy and toxicity with nab-paclitaxel in this group., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients enrolled (44 assessable patients). Main inclusion criteria were histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum (any stage, grade 2 to 3 if stage I) and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or elevated CA-125 (> 70 U/mL) in patients without measurable disease. Patients received nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2) administered intravenously for 30 minutes on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for six cycles or until disease progression., RESULTS: Median age was 65.5 years; 76% of patients had stage IIIC or IV disease, 81% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, and 94% had prior surgery. For assessable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 64% (15 complete responses [CR] and 13 partial responses [PR] among 44 assessable patients). In patients evaluated with RECIST only, the ORR was 45% (one CR and four PR of 11 patients). In patients with only elevated CA-125, ORR was 82% (seven CRs and two PRs of 11 patients). In patients meeting both RECIST and CA-125 criteria, the ORR was 64% (seven CRs and seven PRs of 22 patients). Median time to response was 1.3 months (range, 0.5 to 4.8 months). Estimated median progression-free survival was 8.5 months. The most frequent grade 3 to 4 treatment-related toxicities were neutropenia (24%) and neuropathy (9%)., CONCLUSION: Nab-paclitaxel is active in this group of patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The ORR was 64%. Toxicities were manageable. Further studies of nab-paclitaxel in combination with platinum are warranted.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Abraxane (ABI-007) is a 130-nm albumin-bound (nab) particle formulation of paclitaxel, devoid of any additional excipients. We hypothesized that this change in formulation alters the systemic disposition of paclitaxel compared with conventional solvent-based formulations (sb-paclitaxel; Taxol), and leads to improved tolerability of the drug., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with malignant solid tumors were randomized to receive the recommended single-agent dose of nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) as a 30-minute infusion) or sb-paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) as a 3-hour infusion). After cycle 1, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out for the first cycle of sb-paclitaxel and the first two cycles of nab-paclitaxel., RESULTS: Seventeen patients were treated, with 14 receiving at least one cycle each of nab-paclitaxel and sb-paclitaxel. No change in nab-paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was found between the first and second cycles (P = 0.95), suggesting limited intrasubject variability. Total drug exposure was comparable between the two formulations (P = 0.55) despite the dose difference. However, exposure to unbound paclitaxel was significantly higher after nab-paclitaxel administration, due to the increased free fraction (0.063 +/- 0.021 versus 0.024 +/- 0.009; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: This study shows that paclitaxel disposition is subject to considerable variability depending on the formulation used. Because systemic exposure to unbound paclitaxel is likely a driving force behind tumoral uptake, these findings explain, at least in part, previous observations that the administration of nab-paclitaxel is associated with augmented antitumor efficacy compared with solvent-based paclitaxel.

N2  -  Solvent-based delivery vehicles for chemotherapy agents have been instrumental in providing a means for hydrophobic agents to be administered intravenously. These solvents, however, have been associated with serious and dose-limiting toxicities. Solvent-based formulations of taxanes, a highly active class of cytotoxic agents, are associated with hypersensitivity reactions, neutropenia, and neuropathy. Nanoparticle technology utilizing the human protein albumin exploits natural pathways to selectively deliver larger amounts of drug to tumors while avoiding some of the toxicities of solvent-based formulations. 130 nM albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane) was recently approved for use in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed combination therapy. In a randomized, phase III study in metastatic breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel was found to have improved efficacy and safety compared with conventional, solvent-based paclitaxel. Preliminary data also suggest roles for nab-paclitaxel as a single agent and in combination therapy for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer as well as in other solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and malignant melanoma. The nab technology promises to have broad utility in cancer therapy, and clinical trials are underway using nab formulations of other water-insoluble anticancer agents such as docetaxel and rapamycin.

N2  -  It has been proposed that chemotherapy enhances tumor antigen (TA)-specific immunity. The molecular form of TA from ovarian tumor that activates cellular immunity is unknown. We report here identification of a novel molecular form of immunogenic TA for CD8(+) cells named self-immune stimulatory multimolecular complexes (ISMMC). ISMMC consist of a molecular complex of polyosome/ribosome-bound ubiquitinated nascent HER-2 polypeptides. This complex is chaperoned by heat shock protein Gp96, which mediates ISMMC uptake by antigen-presenting cells through the scavenger receptor CD91. RNAs in ISMMC stimulate immature dendritic cells to secrete interleukin 12 and induce IFN-gamma in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ISMMC dissociate, retrotranslocate from the lysosome to cytoplasm, and are processed to peptides by the proteasome. At subpharmacologic doses, Taxol increased the amount of ISMMC by three to four times and modified their composition by inducing the attachment of cochaperones of HSP70, such as the mitotic-phase phosphoprotein 11J. On a total protein basis, Taxol induced ISMMC, expanded more CD8(+) cells, activated more CD56(+) NKG2D(+) cells to produce IFN-gamma, and were more potent inducers of high T-cell receptor density Perforin(+) cells than native ISMMC and peptide E75. Elucidation of the composition of ISMMC and identification of adducts formed by Taxol should be important for developing molecular cancer vaccines.

N2  -  PURPOSE: 130-nm albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a novel solvent-free albumin-bound paclitaxel, designed to avoid solvent-related toxicity. Nab-paclitaxel has been successfully introduced into the clinic but its radiation-enhancing potential has not yet been evaluated. We conducted a preclinical evaluation of the radiation-modulating effects of nab-paclitaxel in tumor and normal tissues., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mice bearing syngeneic ovarian or mammary carcinomas were treated with nab-paclitaxel, radiation, or combination of both. Nab-paclitaxel was administered at 90 mg/kg, 1.5 times the maximum tolerated dose for solvent-based paclitaxel. End points were antitumor efficacy (growth delay, radiocurability, and cellular effects) and normal tissue toxicity (gut and skin)., RESULTS: Nab-paclitaxel showed single-agent antitumor efficacy against both tumor types and acted as a radiosensitizer. Combined with radiation, nab-paclitaxel produced supra-additive effects when given before radiation. Nab-paclitaxel significantly increased radiocurability by reducing the dose yielding 50% tumor cure (TCD(50)) from 54.3 to 35.2 Gy. Tumor histology following nab-paclitaxel treatment was characterized by pronounced necrotic and apoptotic cell death and mitotic arrest. Nab-paclitaxel did not increase normal tissue radioresponse., CONCLUSIONS: Nab-paclitaxel exhibited strong antitumor efficacy against both tumors as a single agent and it improved radiotherapy in a supra-additive manner. These improved effects were achieved without increased normal tissue toxicity to either rapidly or slowly proliferating normal tissues although the drug dose was 1.5 times higher than the maximum tolerated dose of solvent-based paclitaxel. These preclinical findings show that combining nab-paclitaxel with radiotherapy would improve the outcome of taxane-based chemoradiotherapy. This novel taxane is thus a good candidate for testing in clinical chemoradiotherapy trials.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Albumin-bound paclitaxel, ABI-007 (Abraxane((R))), has a different toxicity profile than solvent-based paclitaxel, including a lower rate of severe neutropenia. The combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin may have significant activity in a variety of tumor types including non-small and small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007, on three different schedules in combination with carboplatin., METHODS: Forty-one patients with solid tumors were enrolled, and received ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin AUC of 6 on day 1. Group A received ABI-007 at doses ranging from 220 to 340 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 days; group B received ABI-007 at 100 or 125 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days; and group C received ABI-007 125 or 150 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Dose-limiting toxicities were assessed after the first cycle. Doses were escalated in cohorts of three to six patients. Fifteen patients participated in a pharmacokinetic study investigating the effects of the sequence of infusion. ABI-007 was infused first followed by carboplatin in cycle 1, and vice versa in cycle 2., RESULTS: The MTD of ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin was 300, 100, and 125 mg/m(2) in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Myelosuppression was the primary dose limiting toxicity. No unexpected or new toxicities were reported. Sequence of infusion did not affect either the pharmacokinetics of ABI-007 or the degree of neutropenia. Responses were seen in melanoma, lung, bladder, esophageal, pancreatic, breast cancer, and cancer of unknown primary., CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose for phase II studies of ABI-007 in combination with carboplatin (AUC of 6) is 300, 100, 125 mg/m(2) for the schedules A, B, and C, respectively. The combination of ABI-007 and carboplatin is well tolerated and active in this heavily pretreated patient population.

N2  -  Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a sensory neuropathy that affects thousands of cancer patients each year as paclitaxel is commonly used to treat breast, non-small cell lung and ovarian cancer. To begin to define the type and location of sensory neurons most impacted by paclitaxel, we examined rat trigeminal ganglion, thoracic and lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) 10 days following intravenous infusion of clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel. To define the population of cells injured by paclitaxel, we examined the expression of activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3), a marker of cell injury; to define the hypertrophy of satellite cells, we quantified the expression of the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); and to define the activation of macrophages, we examined the expression of the lysosomal protein CD68. Intravenous infusion of paclitaxel induced a significant increase of ATF3 in mainly but not exclusively large and medium sensory neurons in all sensory ganglia. An increase in both GFAP immunofluorescence in satellite cells and the number of activated macrophages occurred in lumbar>thoracic>trigeminal ganglia of paclitaxel-treated rats. This differential expression of cellular markers suggests that the largest sensory cell bodies with the longest axons are the most at risk of being injured by paclitaxel (size and length dependent pathology). These results provide a pathological basis for the anatomical distribution of paclitaxel-induced symptoms in patients receiving therapeutic regimens of paclitaxel.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is one of the most active agents in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. However, paclitaxel is solubilized in cremophor, a polyoxyethylated castor oil. Cremophor is allegedly responsible for many paclitaxel-associated hypersensitivity reactions (HSR). Novel agents such as abraxane are solvent free and currently being evaluated to potentially avoid certain patient side effects., CASE: We present a case involving a 60-year-old ovarian cancer patient with a significant history of chemotherapy induced HSR. She underwent optimal cytoreductive surgery and began adjuvant chemotherapy in 2000 until she suffered a severe HSR to paclitaxel. In 2002, she was diagnosed with recurrent disease and underwent subsequent treatment with carboplatin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin, all of which resulted in severe HSR. The patient began abraxane therapy in 2005 and has shown no signs of HSR., CONCLUSION: Abraxane is a solvent free taxane, which can be administered without the pre-medications routinely used to prevent HSR. Abraxane may offer paclitaxel HSR patients the benefit of continued taxane treatment. Although the clinical activity of abraxane has not been extensively investigated in ovarian carcinoma, the distinct activity of paclitaxel and good results with recurrent metastatic breast cancer patients suggest additional evaluation with this drug is important.

N2  -  Src tyrosine kinase has been found to be overexpressed in both mouse and human ovarian cancer cells as well as in human primary ovarian cancers. Furthermore, Src inhibition sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel and cisplatin. Interestingly, Src inhibition has also been shown to resensitize paclitaxel-resistant cells to the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel. The current study was undertaken in an effort to determine the mechanism by which Src resensitizes drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The paclitaxel-resistant human (CaOV3TaxR) and mouse (ID8TaxR) ovarian cancer cell lines express large amounts of the multidrug resistance-1 (MDR-1) protein compared with the paclitaxel-sensitive parent cell lines. Src inhibition had no effect on MDR-1 protein expression. Furthermore, Src inhibition did not affect MDR-1 function as determined by rhodamine 123 and paclitaxel uptake or retention. Coinhibition of both Src and MDR-1 synergistically enhanced paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Inhibition of Src enhanced microtubule stabilization in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells treated with paclitaxel without affecting expression of beta-tubulin isotypes and resulted in multipolar spindle formation and apoptosis. These results show that Src inhibition restores paclitaxel sensitivity to paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells by an MDR-independent mechanism, possibly by decreasing the critical intracellular concentration at which paclitaxel induces tubulin stabilization and bundling. Src tyrosine kinase may provide a viable target for therapeutic intervention in drug-resistant ovarian cancer.

N2  -  PURPOSE: ABI-007 is a novel solvent-free, albumin-bound, 130-nm particle formulation of paclitaxel designed to avoid solvent-related toxicities and to deliver paclitaxel to tumors via molecular pathways involving an endothelial cell-surface albumin receptor (gp60) and an albumin-binding protein expressed by tumor cells and secreted into the tumor interstitium (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine). This study determined the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ABI-007 monotherapy administered weekly (three weekly doses, repeated every 4 weeks) and assessed the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel administered as ABI-007., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies received ABI-007 without premedication at dose levels from 80 to 200 mg/m(2) as a 30-minute intravenous infusion once a week for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest (one cycle)., RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were treated with an average of five cycles of ABI-007; 33% of patients received > or = six cycles of treatment. MTDs for heavily and lightly pretreated patients were 100 and 150 mg/m(2), respectively; and the dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia and grade 3 peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Maximum paclitaxel concentration and area under the curve increased linearly with dose. Dose-dependent changes in plasma clearance did not occur. Partial responses were observed in five patients with breast, lung, and ovarian cancers, all of whom had previously been treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil in the formulation., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that weekly ABI-007 can be administered at doses exceeding those typically used for paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil. Pharmacokinetics were linear over the dose range studied. Antitumor responses occurred in patients previously treated with paclitaxel containing polyoxyethylated castor oil.

N2  -  PURPOSE: This study was carried out to determine the biodistribution profiles and tumor localization potential of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-modified poly(beta-amino ester) (PbAE) as a novel, pH-sensitive biodegradable polymeric nanoparticulate system for tumor-targeted drug delivery., METHODS: The biodistribution studies of PEO-modified PbAE and PEO-modified poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), a non-pH-sensitive polymer, nanoparticle systems were carried out in normal mice using 111indium-oxine [111In] as a lipophilic radiolabel encapsulated within the polymeric matrix, and the distribution of the nanoparticles was studied in plasma and all the vital organs following intravenous administration. Solid tumors were developed on nude mice using human ovarian carcinoma xenograft (SKOV-3) and the change in concentrations of tritium [3H]-labeled paclitaxel encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles was examined in blood, tumor mass, and liver., RESULTS: Study in normal mice with a gamma-emitting isotope [111In] provided a thorough biodistribution analysis of the PEO-modified nanoparticulate carrier systems, whereas 3H-paclitaxel was useful to understand the change in concentration and tumor localization of anticancer compound directly in major sites of distribution. Both PEO-PbAE and PEO-PCL nanoparticles showed long systemic circulating properties by virtue of surface modification with PEO-containing triblock block copolymer (Pluronic stabilizer. Although the PCL nanoparticles showed higher uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, the PbAE nanoparticles effectively delivered the encapsulated payload into the tumor mass., CONCLUSIONS: PEO-modified PbAE nanoparticles showed considerable passive tumor targeting potential in early stages of biodistribution via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) mechanism. This prompts a detailed biodistribution profiling of the nanocarrier for prolonged periods to provide conclusive evidence for superiority of the delivery system.

N2  -  Cyclin A-associated kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), participate in regulating cellular progression from G(1) to S to G(2), and CDK2 has also been implicated in the transition to mitosis. The antitumor properties of CDK inhibitors, alone or in combination with taxanes, are currently being examined in clinical trials. Here, we examined whether the activity of kinases associated with cyclin A (such as CDK2) is important in determining cellular sensitivity to paclitaxel, a taxane and mitotic inhibitor used in chemotherapy for breast and ovarian cancer. We used adenoviral suppression or overexpression to manipulate the expression of CDK2 and cyclin A in one breast cancer and three ovarian cancer cell lines with different sensitivities to paclitaxel and assessed protein expression, kinase activity, cell cycle distribution, and sensitivity to paclitaxel. Transfection of a dominant-negative (DN)-CDK2 evoked resistance to paclitaxel by preventing cellular progression to mitosis through loss of CDK1 activity. Reexpression of wild-type CDK2 in DN-CDK2-transfected cancer cells restored CDK2 activity but not paclitaxel sensitivity. However, expression of cyclin A in DN-CDK2-transfected cells restored their sensitivity to paclitaxel. Although CDK2 activity was not directly involved in paclitaxel sensitivity, cyclin A-associated kinases did up-regulate CDK1 via phosphorylation. We conclude that cyclin A-associated kinase activity is required for these cells to enter mitosis and undergo paclitaxel-induced cell death. Combining taxane chemotherapy with any drug targeting cyclin A-associated kinases (e.g., pure CDK2 inhibitors) should be done with caution, if at all, because of the potential for enhancing taxane resistance.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: Paclitaxel (Taxol), a potent drug of natural origin isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, is widely used in the treatment of ovarian, lung and breast cancer. At present, there is little information regarding the anti-cancer mechanism of paclitaxel against cervical carcinoma cells. We thus tried to show the anti-cancer effect of paclitaxel on cervical carcinoma cell line carrying HPV by using a proteomic analysis and to investigate the mechanism of actions., METHODS: We treated paclitaxel to cervical carcinoma cells and then carried out MTT assay to observe the anti-proliferate activity. Using proteomics analysis including two-dimensional (2-DE) gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS, we tried to find the anti-proliferate activity-related proteins. Among them, paclitaxel treatment suppressed the expression of the mitotic checkpoint protein BUB3. Functional proteomic analysis by small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting was tried to illuminate a role of mitotic checkpoint protein BUB3 in cell cycle progression., RESULTS: The cytotoxicity effects of paclitaxel were determined in HPV-16 positive CaSki, HPV-18 positive HeLa and HPV-negative C33A cervical carcinoma cell lines. Using efficient proteomics methods including 2-DE/MALDI-TOF-MS, we identified several cellular proteins that are responsive to paclitaxel treatment in HeLa cells. Paclitaxel treatment elevated mainly apoptosis-related, immune response-related and cell cycle check point-related proteins. On the other hand, paclitaxel treatment diminished growth factor/oncogene-related proteins and transcription regulation-related proteins. Paclitaxel showed anti-proliferate activity through the membrane death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptotic pathway involving activation of caspase-8 with a TRAIL-dependent fashion as well as the mitochondrial-mediated pathway involving down-regulation of bcl-2 by cytochrome c release. Furthermore, we found siRNA-induced BUB3 knock down on cell cycle progression blocked by cell cycle arrest after paclitaxel treatment., CONCLUSIONS: The proteome profiling technique provided a broad-base and effective approach for the identification of protein changes induced by paclitaxel and showed anti-proliferate activity through the membrane death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, the mitochondrial-mediated pathway. This study shows the power of proteomic profiling with functional analysis using RNAi technology for the discovery of novel molecular targets and a better understanding of the actions of paclitaxel at the molecular level in cervical carcinoma cells.

N2  -  Taxol is one of the most successful drugs for the treatment of cancer because of its ability to target tubulin, block cell cycle progression at mitosis, and induce apoptosis. Despite the success of Taxol, the development of drug resistance hampers its clinical applicability. Herein we report that beta-tubulin mutant, Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells exhibit defective mitotic response to Taxol, even at high concentrations that are sufficient to trigger apoptosis. This mitotic response-defective phenotype is independent of p53 status. We have found that survivin, the mitosis regulator and inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is deregulated in these Taxol-resistant cancer cells; Taxol fails to induce survivin levels and survivin phosphorylation in these cells, in contrast to their parental drug-sensitive counterparts. Exogenous expression of wild-type survivin is able to restore the mitotic response of the resistant cells to Taxol treatment. On the other hand, exogenous expression of dominant-negative survivin abrogates the Taxol-induced mitotic response in drug-sensitive cancer cells. We have also found that overexpression of the mitotic kinase Cdk1, which phosphorylates survivin, is unable to restore the Taxol-induced mitotic response in the resistant cells. Our results show the importance of survivin for the mitotic response in the context of Taxol resistance and provide novel insights into the mechanisms of mitotic arrest and apoptosis induced by microtubule-targeting agents.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To investigate the inhibitory effect of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, sirolimus on expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)1alpha protein and growth of ovarian carcinoma in an athymic mouse xenogeneic transplant model of ovarian cancer., METHODS: Four groups of female nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with SKOV3 cells. After inoculation, mice were treated with saline, rapamycin alone, paclitaxel alone and sirolimus + paclitaxel. In each tumor protein expressions of HIF-1alpha, bcl-2 and apoptosis were determined by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR., RESULTS: In sirolimus and sirolimus + paclitaxel groups protein expression of HIF-1alpha was inhibited. Tumor burden in rapamycin alone, sirolimus + paclitaxel, and paclitaxel alone was reduced by 47.9% (P < 0.05), 51.0% (P < 0.05), and 31.8% (P > 0.05) respectively compared with controls. Cell apoptosis inder in sirolimus alone (36), sirolimus + paclitaxel (40), paclitaxel alone (22), increased compared with control (15), while expression of bcl-2 decreased compared with control., CONCLUSION: Sirolimus inhibited protein expression of HIF-1alpha, increased tumor apoptosis and decreased tumor growth.

N2  -  Drugs that disrupt microtubule dynamics include some of the most important of cancer chemotherapies. While these drugs, which include paclitaxel (Taxol), are known to invoke the mitotic checkpoint, the factors that determine cancer cell killing remain incompletely characterized. Cells that are relatively resistant to killing by these drugs block robustly in mitosis, whereas cells sensitive to killing block only transiently in mitosis before undergoing nuclear fragmentation and death. Passage through mitosis was an absolute requirement of drug-induced death, because death was markedly reduced in cells blocked at both G(1)-S and G(2). Cell killing was at least in part linked to the absence or inactivation of BubR1, a kinetochore-associated phosphoprotein that mediates the mitotic checkpoint. Sensitivity to paclitaxel correlated with decreased BubR1 protein expression in human cancer cell lines, including those derived from breast and ovarian cancers. Silencing of BubR1 via RNA interference inactivated the mitotic checkpoint in drug-resistant cells, and reversed resistance to paclitaxel and nocodazole. Together, these results suggest that the mitotic checkpoint is an important determinant of the efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs in killing cancer cells, potentially providing novel targets for increasing treatment efficacy.

N2  -  ABI 007 [Abraxane] is an albumin-stabilised nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel designed to overcome insolubility problems encountered with paclitaxel. This then eliminates the need for toxic solvents like cremophor, which limits the dose of paclitaxel that can be administered and hence affect overall drug efficacy. Studies have shown that the albumin receptor-mediated paclitaxel-transport mechanism is analogous to the opening of a 'trapdoor' on the endothelial cell wall within blood vessels. This facilitates the passage of ABI 007 from the bloodstream via the blood vessels to the underlying tumour tissue. ABI 007 is being developed for the treatment of a variety of tumour types by American Pharmaceutical Partners. In addition to the standard infusion formulation of ABI 007, oral and pulmonary delivery formulations are also being investigated. American Pharmaceutical Partners, a subsidiary of American BioScience, secured exclusive North American marketing and manufacturing rights to ABI 007 from American BioScience in November 2001. In anticipation of product launch within the fourth quarter of 2004, the company formed Abraxis Oncology and recruited an experienced sales and marketing team. The company has also accumulated approximately 28 million US dollars of paclitaxel inventory. As such, American Pharmaceutical Partners anticipates pre-launch expenses to cost approximately 40 million US dollars, incurred over 2004. In addition, the company expects to make two milestone payments worth 10 million US dollars as well as 15 million US dollars, based upon US FDA acceptance of NDA filing in the second quarter of 2004 and subsequent US FDA approval, respectively. The milestone for US FDA approval would be capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the product.Previously, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that its rolling NDA submission for ABI 007 commenced in May 2003. In July 2003, the company announced that this was progressing on schedule and expected to have completed its entire NDA submission by the end of 2003. The company also began preparations to form a sales and marketing group in anticipation of product launch. In addition, production of commercial quantities of ABI 007 was expected to begin in the second half of 2003. The US FDA granted fast-track status to ABI 007 for this indication in January 2003. The decision for NDA filing was based on the successful completion of a phase III trial evaluating ABI 007 versus standard paclitaxel among 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer in the US. In September 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners and American BioScience jointly announced positive interim results from the trial, which shows that the primary efficacy objective had been exceeded. American BioScience completed this phase III trial in early 2003 with the results unblinded in mid-2003. The phase III study directly compared the efficacy of ABI 007 260 mg/m(2) versus paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2). Both agents were administered every 3 weeks. ABI 007 was administered as a 30-minute infusion without steroid pretreatment. Paclitaxel-treated patients received steroid pretreatment and the drug was administered over 3 hours. Enrollment was completed in December 2002 with 460 first- and second-line metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled. A Data Monitoring Committee concluded in October 2002 that a sample-size adjustment of the phase III trial was not required and that the study could be continued to completion. A phase II trial of ABI 007 was also underway in metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed taxane therapy. The trial was evaluating a weekly rather than 3-weekly regimen of ABI 007. Also in February 2004, American BioScience initiated a multicentre phase II trial in patients with metastatic melanoma. The trial will evaluate both chemotherapy-naive patients (at a dose of 150 mg/m(2) administered weekly) and patients who have previously received chemotherapy (at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) administered weekly) as treatment for metastatic disease. In May 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that ABI 007 is also being evaluated for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and cervical cancers. Phase I/II trials have also been conducted in other solid tumours, including squamous cell cancer of the head and neck, and pelvis. Phase I trials have also been conducted in patients with solid tumours to evaluate the administration of ABI 007 on a weekly schedule. In September 2003, American BioScience was issued US patent No. 6,506,405, which has 89 claims covering compositions of matter and unit dosage forms. In addition, the patent covers methods of use without the requirement for pretreatment with steroid therapy or growth factor support. In July 2003, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington DC unanimously ruled that American BioScience is the true and rightful owner of patent No. 5,780,653. This patent covers three next-generation taxane anticancer compounds. This ruling overturned a lower court decision in a lawsuit brought in 1998 by Florida State University (FSU) and FSU Prof. Robert Holton's privately held company, Taxolog. In the lawsuit, FSU and Taxolog alleged that Prof. Holton and others at FSU were the true inventors of the compounds claimed under American BioScience's patent.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: The role of MDR1 in clinical paclitaxel resistance remains poorly characterized. This study sought to identify the incidence and significance of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression on survival, tumor response to paclitaxel and the effect of prior cytotoxic exposure on P-gp expression in patients with paired primary and recurrent ovarian cancer samples., METHODS: Retrospective survival analysis. P-gp expression was evaluated immunohistochemically with antibodies c494 and c219., RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were identified from the tumor registry. Median interval between primary and secondary surgery was 17.9 (5.7-40.9) months. Only five primary tumors (16%) demonstrated +++ staining for P-gp. First-line treatment contained paclitaxel in 17 patients (53%) and 26 patients (81%) had been exposed to P-gp exportable chemotherapy before second surgery. Only seven of the recurrent tumors (22%) were +++. Only one of seven (14% (95% CI 0-46%)) recurrent tumors with ++ or +++ staining responded to subsequent paclitaxel, while 8 of 10 (80% (CI 46-100%)) recurrent tumors with 0/+ staining responded (P = 0.025). In multivariate analysis of outcome following second surgery, response to paclitaxel (P = 0.004) and P-gp over-expression (P < 0.001) were significant predictors of survival., CONCLUSIONS: De novo strong P-gp over-expression is uncommon, appears to change little over time or with prior exposure to chemotherapy. However, P-gp over-expression is a significant prognostic factor, and at the time of disease, relapse is inversely correlated with tumor response to paclitaxel.

The phase III study directly compared the efficacy of ABI 007 260 mg/m(2) with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2). Both agents were administered every 3 weeks. ABI 007 was administered as a 30-minute infusion without steroid pretreatment. Paclitaxel-treated patients received steroid pretreatment and the drug was administered over 3 hours. In October 2002, a Data Monitoring Committee concluded that a sample size adjustment of the phase III trial would not be required and that the study can be continued to completion. Enrolment was completed in December 2002 with 460 first- and second-line metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled. The results were expected to be unblinded in mid-2003. A phase II trial of ABI 007 is also underway in metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed taxane therapy. The trial is evaluating a weekly rather than 3-weekly regimen of ABI 007. Earlier, in May 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that ABI 007 is also being evaluated for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and cervical cancers. However, the phase of development for these indications remains unclear.

N2  -  A combination of paclitaxel (Taxol) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK/Erk) inhibitor represents a rational new approach to chemotherapy. We performed Affymetrix microarray analysis to understand the global effects of this combination in lung carcinoma. Genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, adhesion, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis were modulated. We observed similar patterns of gene modulation in ovarian and melanoma cell lines, indicating the general applicability of these findings. Functional genomic analysis identified two genes as new targets of drug-induced tumor apoptosis. The MGSA/Gro1 gene, important in melanoma growth, was induced by paclitaxel and reduced by MEK inhibition. Blockage of paclitaxel-induced melanoma growth stimulatory activity significantly reduced melanoma growth. Additionally, the expression of topoisomerase III beta, which exhibited a clear pattern of gene reduction by a combination of the two drugs, was significantly increased (5.7-fold) in primary lung cancers but not adjacent tissues. These findings provide potential new biomarkers and gene targets for the development of improved cancer treatment.

N2  -  Taxanes act by inhibiting microtubule dynamics; in this study, we have investigated mitochondria as an additional target of taxanes. We incubated isolated mitochondria in the presence of taxanes with or without stimulation of the mitochondrial respiratory state. Results showed that they rapidly induced the loss of deltapsim after stimulation of the respiratory state. To evaluate the binding of [14C]paclitaxel to isolated mitochondria, mitochondrial proteins were precipitated yielding 18.6 +/- 2.1 cpm/microg of protein. After stimulation of the respiratory state, binding of [14C]paclitaxel increased up to 163.2 +/- 46.7 cpm/microg of protein. CPM values after Bcl-2 immunoprecipitation was 62.8-fold higher than those of the control antibody, thereby indicating the involvement of Bcl-2 in paclitaxel binding. Then, we established a panel of A2780 cell lines resistant to increasing doses of paclitaxel alone or to high doses of paclitaxel/cyclosporin A (A2780 TC cells). In both cases, Bcl-2 expression was consistently down-regulated, whereas levels of other members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax and Bcl-x, did not change in paclitaxel-resistant cell lines. When A2780TC cells were stably transfected with a Bcl-2 construct, paclitaxel sensitivity was partially restored, thereby supporting a direct role of Bcl-2 down-regulation in the maintenance of drug-resistance. Finally, we examined Bcl-2 by immunohistochemistry in a small subset of ovarian cancer paclitaxel-resistant patients and we noticed that the protein is down-regulated in this clinical setting with respect to the expression levels found in drug-sensitive tumors. These findings demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an additional intracellular target of taxanes and that its down-regulation is involved in taxane resistance.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol), a naturally occurring antimitotic agent, has shown significant cell-killing activity against human solid tumor cells through induction of apoptosis. The molecular mechanism underlying paclitaxel-induced apoptosis is not entirely clear. Using the unique inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, we recently discovered that paclitaxel-induced inhibitor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) degradation and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation might contribute to the mediation of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. In this study, using a novel IkappaBalpha phosphorylation inhibitor, we demonstrated that the blockage of paclitaxel-induced IkappaBalpha degradation inhibited apoptotic cell death in human breast cancer BCap37 and ovarian cancer OV2008 cell lines. Furthermore, in vitro kinase assays showed that the activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK), which is responsible for the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB proteins, was significantly activated by paclitaxel in these paclitaxel-sensitive tumor cells. Stable transfection of a mutant IkappaBalpha lacking Ser(32) and Ser(36) that was insensitive to IKK-mediated phosphorylation and degradation resulted in reduced sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we also found that the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1, an upstream regulator of IKK, was up-regulated by paclitaxel. These findings suggest that the activation of IKK might play a critical role in the regulation of paclitaxel-induced NF-kappaB activation that subsequently mediates paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death in solid tumor cells.

N2  -  The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein, which functions as a tumor suppressor gene. We present several lines of evidence for the mechanism of BRCA1 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by using specific inhibitors of the proteasome in human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The levels of BRCA1 protein were up-regulated by proteasome inhibitors, such as MG-132 and ALLnL, suggesting rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The enhanced loss of BRCA1 protein by taxol, okadaic acid or nocodazole treatment was prevented by the proteasome inhibitors, while inhibition of other proteases was ineffective. Accumulation and proteasomal degradation of BRCA1 protein appear to be restricted entirely to the nucleus. We also detected that high molecular weight BRCA1 protein species appeared after proteasome inhibitor treatments, which indicated that ubiquitinated species were present. Moreover the half-life of BRCA1 protein was significantly increased in response to inhibition of proteasome activity. Our present data demonstrate that BRCA1 protein may be degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome mediated pathway.

N2  -  Paclitaxel has been found to be very effective against several human cancers, such as ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer and has received marketing approval for metastatic cancers. One of main problems with its use is its poor solubility, which makes irritant solubilitazion agents necessary. In previous research we demonstrated that linkage to human serum albumin (HSA) was useful to increase the in vivo performance of paclitaxel. In this article, in order to improve stability and solubility of paclitaxel conjugate, we linked covalently a monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) chain to HSA. New thioimidate mPEG derivatives, highly reactive and stable, were used and two different conjugates (with PEG of molecular mass 2 or 5 kDa) were prepared, purified and characterized. The antitumor activity of the free drug and conjugates was tested on three different tumor cell lines. The PEG grafted conjugates maintained high cytotoxicity, similar to that of ungrafted conjugates, with efficient cell binding and internalization followed by release of the drug inside the cell. The changes in pharmacokinetics and distribution of radio-labelled conjugates were evaluated by i.v. administration to mice and compared with those of the free drug and ungrafted conjugates. The total clearance was reduced (from 3.6 ml/h for free drug to 2.9, 1.97 and 1.41 for ungrafted, 2 and 5 kDa PEG conjugates, respectively). Organ uptake was reduced, in particular by liver and spleen.

N2  -  The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1/SD11 (p21) plays a crucial role in DNA repair, cell differentiation, and apoptosis through regulation of the cell cycle. A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells, which are sensitive to cisplatin and paclitaxel, express wild-type p53 and exhibit a p53-mediated increase in p21 in response to the chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream targets serine/threonine kinases AKT1 and AKT2 (AKT), are required for the full induction of p21 in A2780 cells treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel. Inactivation of the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway either by its specific inhibitor LY294002 or by expression of dominant negative AKT inhibited p21 expression but had no inhibitory effect on the expression of the proapoptotic protein BAX by cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment. In addition, overexpression of wild-type or constitutively active AKT in A2780 cells sustained the regulation of p21 induction or increased the level of p21 expression, respectively. Experiments with additional ovarian carcinoma cell lines revealed that PI3K is involved in the expression of p21 induced by cisplatin or paclitaxel in OVCAR-10 cells, which have wild-type p53, but not in OVCAR-5 cells, which lack functional p53. These data indicate that the PI3K/AKT signal transduction pathway mediates p21 expression and suggest that this pathway contributes to cell cycle regulation promoted by p53 in response to drug-induced stress. However, inactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling did not result in significant alteration of the drug sensitivity of A2780 cells, suggesting that the cell death induced by cisplatin or paclitaxel proceeds independently of cell protective effects of PI3K and AKT.

N2  -  SCH58500 (ACN53) is a replication-deficient, recombinant adenovirus which expresses human p53 tumor suppressor. In preclinical models, SCH58500 has therapeutic efficacy against a wide range of human tumor types containing nonfunctional p53 and it has enhanced activity in combination with many chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the anti-tumor efficacy of SCH58500 combined with the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic cyclophosphamide has not been previously reported. Cyclophosphamide did not enhance the activity of SCH58500 in three out of four human tumor xenograft models studied. Furthermore, combination therapy with SCH58500 and cyclophosphamide was not any better than single drug treatment in transgenic H-ras mice and in FVB mice bearing syngeneic MidT2-1 tumors. This is in sharp contrast to previous combination studies in these models where SCH58500 had enhanced efficacy when given with the farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor SCH66336, paclitaxel, cisplatin, cisplatin/paclitaxel, or doxorubicin. Further evaluation of this combination is required before it can be recommended for clinical trials in cancer patients.

N2  -  Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a diterpenoid isolated from Taxus brevifolia, approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian and breast cancers. Due to its low solubility in water, it is clinically administered dissolved in Cremophor EL, (polyethoxylated castor oil) and ethanol, which cause serious side effects. Inclusion of paclitaxel in liposomal formulations has proved to be a good approach to eliminating this vehicle and improving the drug's antitumor efficacy. We prepared different conventional and PEGylated liposomes containing paclitaxel and determined encapsulation efficiency, physical stability and drug leakage in human plasma. The best conventional liposome formulation was composed of ePC/PG 9:1, while for PEGylated liposomes the best composition was ePC/PG/CHOL/PEG(5000)-DPPE 9:1:2:0.7. PEGylated liposomes were found to be less stable during storage than the corresponding conventional liposomes and to have lower drug release in human plasma at 37 degrees C. In vitro cytotoxic activities were evaluated on HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma and MeWo melanoma cell lines. After 2 and 48 h, conventional liposomes had the same cytotoxicity as free paclitaxel, while PEGylated liposomes were as active as free drug, only after 48 h. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution were evaluated in Balb/c mice after i.v. injection of paclitaxel, formulated in Cremophor EL or in conventional or in PEGylated liposomes. Encapsulation of paclitaxel in conventional liposomes produced marked differences over the free drug pharmacokinetics. PEGylated liposomes were long-circulating liposomes, with an increased t(1/2) beta 48.6 h, against t(1/2) beta 9.27 h of conventional liposomes. Biodistribution studies showed a considerable decrease in drug uptake in MPS-containing organs (liver and spleen) at 0.5 and 3 h after injection with PEGylated compared to conventional liposomes.

N2  -  SCH58500 is an agent for gene therapy of cancer, consisting of a replication-deficient type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) expressing the human p53 tumor suppressor gene (Ad5/p53). An important question about the use of Ad5/p53 gene therapy is how to achieve the therapeutically effective delivery of an Ad5/p53 vector to the tumor. We wanted to determine the effective depth of penetration of an Ad5/p53 vector by dosing the vector in an experimental human xenograft/SCID model. To assess depth of penetration, we developed a novel methodology for scanning tissue sections by laser scanning cytometry (LSC). SCID mice were given intraperitoneal injections of either p53(null) SK-OV-3 human ovarian tumor cells or p53(mut) DU-145 human prostate tumor cells to establish xenograft solid tumors. Mice were then dosed once or twice at 24-hour intervals by intraperitoneal injection with SCH58500 (Ad5/p53), an adenovirus construct expressing beta-galactosidase (Ad5/beta-gal), or a buffer control. Additional groups of mice received a single intraperitoneal dose of 10 mg/kg paclitaxel either alone or coadministered with Ad5/p53. Twenty-four hours after each last dose, the human solid tumor xenograft and relevant mouse tissue were removed from each mouse for the analysis of Ad5/p53 penetration. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for beta-galactosidase protein revealed a depth of penetration of between 1 and 10 cells from the tumor surface. In some mice, hepatocytes in the periportal regions of liver lobules were also positive, indicating systemic absorption of adenovirus from the peritoneal cavity. IHC staining for p53 and p21 proteins in SK-OV-3 solid tumor xenografts revealed similar Ad/p53 penetration. LSC was used to map and quantitate apoptosis in both tumor and liver tissue biopsies, with over 450,000 nuclei from liver tissue and 150,000 nuclei from tumor tissue being evaluated. LSC analysis demonstrated a high level of apoptosis in the tumors that had been removed from Ad5/p53-dosed mice (12.7-19.7%). This level of apoptosis was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than was observed for liver tissues taken from Ad5/p53-dosed mice (2.7-8.0%) or tumor tissues taken from either Ad5/beta-gal-dosed mice (3.0-6.4%) or buffer control-dosed mice (3.0-5.3%). Scan bit maps from the extensive LSC analyses confirmed that apoptosis was present to about the same depth (1-10 cells) as had been identified by IHC for beta-galactosidase, p53, and p21 proteins. Paclitaxel coadministered with Ad5/p53 had no effect on Ad5 penetration into solid tumors in vivo as measured by IHC for p53 or p21 protein. However, the combination therapy did cause an elevation in the number of tumor cells undergoing apoptosis.

N2  -  In an attempt to define the molecular changes associated with the paclitaxel-resistant phenotype in human cancer, a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell line, SKOV-3TR, was established through stepwise selection in increasing paclitaxel concentrations. SKOV-3TR was cross- resistant to doxorubicin and vincristine and overexpressed multidrug resistance gene 1 but not multidrug resistance associated protein. SKOV-3TR and the paclitaxel-sensitive SKOV-3 parent line were characterized using human cDNA array technology that examined expression of a wide variety of genes involved in cell growth, signal transduction, cell death, and immune function. cDNA probes from reverse transcribed mRNAs of both paclitaxel-resistant and parent cells were compared to identify genes differentially expressed in the paclitaxel-resistant cells. Of 588 different human cDNA transcripts compared, 6 genes were found to be markedly decreased, and 12 genes increased in the resistant subline. Northern analysis and/or reverse transcription-PCR confirmed that 12 of these 18 genes were over- or underexpressed in SKOV-3TR. In addition, at least eight of the genes were found differentially expressed in several other paclitaxel- and/or doxorubicin-resistant cell lines, both those with increased multidrug resistance expression and those without. Included in the set of overexpressed genes were the cytokines/chemokines interleukin 6, interleukin 8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. ELISA assays confirm that mRNA overexpression of these cytokine/chemokines was associated with the increased secretion of these molecules in the tissue culture supernatant. Evaluation of supernatants from an expanded collection of paclitaxel- and Adriamycin-resistant cell lines demonstrated that all of the resistant lines had significant overexpression of at least one cytokine/chemokine as compared with their drug-sensitive parent line. The overexpression of these cytokines seemed to be stable and associated with a drug-resistant phenotype with only a modest induction of cytokine expression in the parent line with short-term paclitaxel exposure. These findings suggest that the development of paclitaxel resistance is accompanied by multiple changes in gene expression including stable alterations in selective chemokine and cytokine expression. The role these associated genetic changes have in the drug-resistant phenotype is discussed.

N2  -  Combination chemotherapy using paclitaxel with a platinum-based regimen is currently the standard first-line therapy for ovarian cancer after surgical cytoreduction. Whereas cisplatin-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy has shown significant efficacy over previous drug combinations in ovarian cancer, 20-30% of patients fail to respond to this combination. These patients are deemed cisplatin-paclitaxel resistant, although it is unclear whether the tumors are resistant to one or both drugs. Because the options available to ovarian cancer patients for second-line therapy are limited, and knowing that mechanistic differences exist between cisplatin and paclitaxel, we assessed the efficacy of combination drug therapy on cisplatin-resistant (cisplatinR) ovarian cancer cells. We found that paclitaxel induced apoptosis in cisplatinR cells as well as in the cisplatin-sensitive parental cell lines. In cisplatinR C-13 cells, the concomitant addition of cisplatin blocked paclitaxel-induced apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation assays, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry. Paclitaxel-induced multimininucleation was also inhibited when the cells were exposed sequentially to paclitaxel and then cisplatin. Cisplatin did not block paclitaxel-induced stabilization of microtubules or prevent paclitaxel-induced loss of Bcl-2 expression in cisplatinR cells. Conversely, paclitaxel did not inhibit p53 protein accumulation by cisplatin. These results suggest that cisplatin blocks paclitaxel-induced apoptosis at a point downstream of Bcl-2 degradation and independent of microtubule stabilization. Our research shows that cisplatin can inhibit the effectiveness of paclitaxel in cispatinR cell lines. Therefore, the establishment of a clinical protocol to evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel alone versus another second-line regimen in patients with cisplatin-paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer is warranted.

N2  -  We previously reported the pharmacodynamics of antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of paclitaxel in histocultures of bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate tumors obtained from patients. This study examined the relationship between paclitaxel pharmacodynamics and tumor pathobiological parameters [i.e., stage, grade, proliferation status, expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), p53, and Bcl-2]. Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 proteins were detected by immunohistochemical methods. The drug sensitivity rank order of the five tumor types is as follows: prostate > or = head and neck = bladder > breast > ovarian for the antiproliferative effect and breast = ovarian = head and neck > prostate = bladder for the apoptotic effect. When the pathobiological parameters were considered as single parameters, the antiproliferative effect was inversely correlated with tumor stage, grade, labeling index (LI), and expression of Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 (P < 0.05 in all cases). The apoptotic effect was positively correlated with Pgp expression, LI, and tumor grade (P < 0.01) but was not related to tumor stage and expression of p53 and Bcl-2 (P > 0.2). Results of multivariate analysis indicated that the maximum antiproliferative effect was best predicted by the combination of tumor stage and expression of Pgp and p53 (inverse correlation) and that the maximum apoptotic effect was best predicted by the combination of tumor LI and Pgp expression (positive correlation). In summary, these results indicate that the two major effects of paclitaxel in human solid tumors, i.e., antiproliferation and apoptosis, correlate with different tumor properties. The second finding that drug-induced apoptosis was equal or higher in tumors that expressed Pgp, p53, and Bcl-2 compared to tumors that did not express these proteins supports the use of paclitaxel in treating Pgp-, p53- and Bcl-2-positive tumors.

N2  -  It has been shown recently that expression of p21 is enhanced by paclitaxel. This cytotoxic compound induces mitotic spindle damage resulting in blockade of the mitotic cell cycle associated or not with apoptotic cell death. In the present study, we showed that, in MCF-7 cells, paclitaxel induced accumulation of p21 in cells with a G2/M DNA content, corresponding to cells either in abnormal mitosis or in an interphase-like state (decondensed chromatin) with multiple nuclei. In MCF-7 cells, the increase in p21 was subsequent to the mitotic arrest and was associated with the exit from abnormal mitosis leading to formation of cells with micronuclei. In this cell line, we noted a relationship between the elevation of p21 expression and the inhibition of p34cdc2 activity. High levels of p21 protein were also found to be associated with inactive p34cdc2/cyclin B protein complex after treatment with paclitaxel. Treatment with p21 antisense oligonucleotide partially blocked induction of p21 expression by paclitaxel and significantly reduced survival of MCF-7 cells exposed to this agent. In NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, which are deficient in basal and paclitaxel-induced p21 expression, paclitaxel led to a prolonged activation of p34cdc2 and a delayed mitotic exit associated with apoptotic cell death. These observations suggest that p21 is not required for the mitotic arrest in response to paclitaxel, but argue in favor of a role for this inhibitor in facilitating the exit from abnormal mitosis. This effectively enhances cell survival after paclitaxel-induced spindle damage.

N2  -  Tumor cells grown as multicellular spheroids are known to be intrinsically more resistant to a large and diverse array of anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs compared to the same cells grown as dispersed monolayer cell cultures. Some drugs, however, seem relatively insensitive to this multicellular drug resistance, e.g., cisplatinum. Whether the cytotoxic effects of Taxol, an anticancer drug of growing importance in the treatment of breast and ovarian carcinomas, are diminished by multicellular growth conditions is unknown. To study this question, we examined the relative sensitivity of a panel of four different human ovarian carcinoma cell lines to either Taxol or cisplatinum. Upon exposure to Taxol, all the cell lines manifested a relative drug-resistant phenotype when grown as multicellular tumor spheroids, compared to the same cells grown as sparse monolayer cultures. This multicellular-dependent drug-resistant phenotype was not observed when the same cells were exposed to cisplatinum for an equivalent length of time. Monolayer but not spheroid cultures exposed to Taxol demonstrated an accumulation of cells at G2-M and a sub-G1 apoptotic region. In addition, Taxol-induced apoptosis was detected in monolayer conditions but not in the spheroid cultures. The relative sensitivity of the monolayer cell cultures was associated with a decrease in bcl-X(L) protein levels after Taxol exposure, an effect not observed in drug-exposed spheroids. Taken together, these results suggest that some aspects of intrinsic Taxol resistance in ovarian carcinoma may be due to multicellular-dependent or -associated mechanisms. This raises the possibility of using antiadhesive agents to reverse multicellular-dependent Taxol resistance in certain circumstances as a potential means of increasing the initial efficiency of Taxol therapy against ovarian carcinoma.

N2  -  Taxol-resistant clones from a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (2008) were selected by an initial exposure to 0.05 microM (2008/13) or 0.5 microM (2008/17) taxol. Thereafter, a series of clones with increasing taxol resistance were derived from the 2008/17 and 2008/13 cells by stepwise sequential exposure to increasing concentrations of taxol. The 2008/17 clones displayed a classical P-glycoprotein-mediated drug-resistance phenotype. In contrast, the 2008/13 clones followed the classical P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance phenotype until a 245-fold taxol-resistant clone (2008/13/2) was obtained, which was followed by a further increase in the degree of resistance but significant down-regulation of P-glycoprotein expression in the 252-fold taxol-resistant 2008/13/4 cells. This clone (2008/13/4) also accumulated significantly higher intracellular levels of taxol than those expressing the P-glycoprotein. No correlation between the expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein and taxol resistance was observed. Verapamil increased the sensitivity of all drug-resistant clones to taxol, and this was probably related to the ability of verapamil to increase the intracellular concentration of taxol (except in the case of 2008/13/4 cells). The 2008/17 clones were highly cross-resistant to Adriamycin, etoposide, and vincristine. They also displayed a low level of cross-resistance to camptothecin but were not cross-resistant to cisplatin. The taxol-resistant 2008/13 clones displayed a similar pattern of cross-resistance for all drugs (except Adriamycin). The 2008/13 clones were only 2-to 4-fold cross-resistant Adriamycin. The levels of alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin were similar in the parental 2008 and taxol-resistant 2008/13/4 cells. Furthermore, the in vitro binding of [3H]taxol to semipurified microtubule preparations derived from the parental 2008 and the taxol-resistant 2008/13/2 and 2008/13/4 cells was similar. These results show that in human ovarian carcinoma cells resistance to taxol can be acquired via as yet undescribed mechanisms.

N2  -  Epothilones A and B, natural products with minimal structural analogy to taxoids, have effects similar to those of paclitaxel (Taxol(R)) in cultured cells and on microtubule protein, but differ from paclitaxel in retaining activity in multidrug-resistant cells. We examined interactions of the epothilones with purified tubulin and additional cell lines, including a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma line with an altered beta-tubulin. The epothilones, like paclitaxel, induced tubulin to form microtubules at low temperatures and without GTP and/or microtubule-associated proteins. The epothilones are competitive inhibitors of the binding of [3H]paclitaxel to tubulin polymers. The apparent Ki values for epothilones A and B were 1.4 and 0.7 microM by Hanes analysis and 0.6 and 0.4 microM by Dixon analysis. In the paclitaxel-sensitive human cell lines we examined, epothilone B had greater antiproliferative activity than epothilone A or paclitaxel, while epothilone A was usually less active than paclitaxel. A multidrug-resistant colon carcinoma line and the paclitaxel-resistant ovarian line retained sensitivity to the epothilones. With Potorous tridactylis kidney epithelial (PtK2) cells examined by indirect immunofluorescence, microtubule bundles appeared more rapidly following epothilone B treatment, and there were different proportions of various mitotic aberrations following treatment with different drugs.

N2  -  Camptothecin (CPT) and taxol are secondary metabolites found in the stembark of Camptotheca acuminata, a native of China, and Taxus brevifolia, found in the northwest Pacific coastal region of the USA, respectively. The compounds were isolated through bioassay-guided fractionation of various extracts and through chromatographic fractions. Their unique and hitherto unknown structures were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and X-ray analysis. Both compounds have unique mechanisms of antitumor activity; CPT uniquely inhibits an enzyme, topoisomerase I, involved in DNA replication, while taxol binds to a protein, tubulin, thus inhibiting cell division. Taxol has been called the best new anticancer agent developed from natural products, showing particular efficacy against ovarian cancer. CPT and analogs singly or combined with cisplatinum show efficacy against solid tumors, breast, lung, and colorectal, which hitherto have been unaffected by most cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

N2  -  Taxol stabilizes microtubules, prevents tubulin depolymerization, and promotes tubulin bundling and is one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast and ovarian cancer. Although its interaction with tubulin has been well characterized, the mechanism by which taxol induces growth arrest and cytotoxicity is not well understood. Herein, we show that taxol induced dose- and time-dependent accumulation of the cyclin inhibitor p21WAF1 in both p53 wild-type and p53-null cells, although the degree of induction was greater in cells expressing wild-type p53. In MCF7 cells, wild-type p53 protein was also induced after taxol treatment, and this induction was mediated primarily by increased protein stability. Taxol induced both p21WAF1 and wild-type p53 optimally in MCF7 cells after 20-24-h exposure with an EC50(3) of 5 nM. In p53-null PC3M cells, p21WAF1 was similarly induced after 24-h exposure to taxol. Coincident with these biochemical effects, taxol altered the electrophoretic mobility of c-raf-1 and stimulated mitogen activated protein kinase. Previous depletion of c-raf-1 inhibited both the p21WAF1- and p53-inducing properties of taxol, as well as the activation of MAP kinase. These data suggest that induction of p21WAF1 by taxol requires c-raf-1 activity, but that it is not strictly dependent on wild-type p53. Furthermore, the ability of taxol to both induce wild-type p53 in MCF7 cells and activate MAP kinase is also dependent on c-raf-1 expression.

N2  -  Taxol, an inhibitor of microtubule disaggregation, is used in the therapy of breast, ovarian, and other human malignancies. The toxicity of taxol administration is due in part to the polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremaphor) vehicle in which it is administered; taxol embryotoxicity appears also to be partially attributable to vehicle toxicity. Liposome encapsulation is a novel vehicle for drug administration. The administration of taxol encapsulated in liposomes was evaluated in the chick embryo. Albumen injections of taxol doses up to 30 micrograms/egg were used to characterize dose-response curves for free and liposome-encapsulated taxol, compared to liposome-only and saline-injected control eggs. Sixty percent embryotoxicity (death or malformation) occurred with taxol doses of 1.5 micrograms/egg. A 20-fold higher dose was necessary to produce the same degree of toxicity with liposome-encapsulated taxol. Curve-fitting equations were used to estimate median effective doses (ED50s) and slope functions of the dose response curves. The ED50 for taxol was more than an order of magnitude lower than that for liposome-encapsulated taxol. Estimated slope functions for the two dosage forms of taxol were the same, suggesting similar mechanisms of toxicity. The toxicity of liposomes alone was low.

N2  -  Paclitaxel, an antitumor drug that is demonstrating encouraging activity in human malignancies, is likely to play a major role in cancer chemotherapy. Paclitaxel has an unusual chemical structure--it is a complex diterpene having a taxane ring with a four-membered oxetane ring and an ester side chain at position C-13--and a unique mechanism of action. In vitro, paclitaxel enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization by cold and calcium, which readily depolymerize normal microtubules. The fact that the drug has a specific binding site on the microtubule polymer makes it unique among chemotherapeutic agents, and the ability of paclitaxel to polymerize tubulin in the absence of cofactors like guanosine triphosphate and microtubule-associated proteins is unusual. When paclitaxel and microtubule protein are irradiated with ultraviolet light, the drug preferentially binds covalently to the beta-subunit of tubulin. Paclitaxel binds to cells in a specific and saturable manner with a single set of high-affinity binding sites. The microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized in the presence of paclitaxel and extensive parallel arrays or stable bundles of microtubules are formed in cells growing in tissue culture. Paclitaxel blocks cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and such cells are unable to form a normal mitotic apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  -  Taxol, a natural product initially isolated from the stem bark of the western yew Taxus brevifolia, is undergoing phase II and III evaluation due to its reported activity against a variety of tumors. Previous studies have described correlations between plasma concentrations and toxicity when taxol is given (a) at lower doses, (b) for shorter infusion times, and (c) without granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor. Because the 24-h infusion schedule is most commonly used in current clinical trials, we attempted to correlate steady-state plasma concentrations of taxol achieved with a 24-h continuous i.v. infusion with toxicities and responses. Plasma samples from 48 refractory ovarian cancer patients were obtained 1-2 h prior to the end of the first taxol infusion. Taxol concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Interpatient variation of taxol plasma concentrations was small (mean +/- SD, 0.85 +/- 0.21 microM. Total taxol body clearance was 256 +/- 72 ml min-1 m-2 (mean +/- SD). Taxol plasma protein binding was 88.4% +/- 1.3% (mean +/- SD, n = 9). Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, mainly leukopenia, occurred in 92% of the patients. The leukopenia was transient and did not warrant a reduction in the dose of taxol. Grade 3-4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 8% of the patients. No severe hypersensitivity reaction or grade 3-4 neurotoxicity was observed. Correlations of plasma concentrations and toxicities were not feasible due to the high frequency of hematologic effects and the low frequency of nonhematologic toxicity. The low degree of interpatient variation in plasma concentrations hindered the development of correlations with response.
