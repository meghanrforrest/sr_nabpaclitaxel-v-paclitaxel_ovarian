N2  -  Background: Nanoparticles hold considerable promise for aerosol‐based intraperitoneal delivery in patients with carcinomatosis. Recently, results from preclinical and early clinical trials suggested that albumin‐bound paclitaxel (ABP, Abraxane™) may result in superior efficacy in the treatment of peritoneal metastases (PM) compared to the standard solvent‐based paclitaxel formulation (Taxol™). Here, we propose a phase I study of pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) using ABP in patients with upper Gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer. Methods: Eligible patients with advanced, biopsy‐proven PM from ovarian, breast, gastric, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic origin will undergo three PIPAC treatments using ABP with a 4‐week interval. The dose of ABP will be escalated from 35 to 140mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the maximally tolerated dose is determined. The primary end point is dose‐limiting toxicity. Secondary analyses include surgical morbidity, non‐access rate, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, quality of life, and exploratory circulating biomarker analyses. Discussion: ABP holds considerable promise for intraperitoneal aerosol delivery. The aim of this study is to determine the dose level for future randomized phase II trials using ABP in PIPAC therapy.

N2  -  PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab (BEV) combined with albumin‐bound paclitaxel (ABP) in the treatment of platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: Eighty‐six patients with platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian cancer admitted to our hospital from March 2014 to March 2016 were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups, namely, BEV + ABP group (n=43, treated with BEV combined with ABP) and ABP group (n=43, treated with ABP alone). Next, the clinical objective response rate (ORR), changes in serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) level and adverse reactions were compared between two groups. Additionally, the progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed and recorded after treatment. RESULTS: The clinical ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 86.0% (37/43) and 93.0% (40/43) in BEV + ABP group and 62.8% (27/43) and 79.1% (34/43) in ABP group, respectively. The clinical ORR of patients exhibited a statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.025), which was overtly higher in BEV + ABP group than that in ABP group, while the DCR had no statistically significant difference between two groups (p=0.117). The serum CA125 level was evidently decreased in both groups after treatment (p<0.05) compared with that before treatment, but it displayed no statistically significant difference between two groups after treatment (p=0.220). The major adverse reactions of patients were myelosuppression, gastrointestinal reaction, alopecia, rash, fatigue and peripheral neurotoxicity. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of adverse reactions between two groups (p>0.05). All patients were followed up for 6‐29 months. The median OS of patients was 16.3 months and 12.6 months in BEV + ABP group and ABP group, respectively, which was clearly longer in BEV + ABP group than that in ABP group (p=0.007). The median PFS in BEV + ABP group was obviously longer than that in ABP group (8.9 months vs. 6.7 months, p=0.028). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with ABP alone, BEV combined with ABP applied in the treatment of platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian cancer prominently improves the clinical efficacy, PFS and OS, with good tolerance of patients, which is worthy of popularization and application in clinical practice.

N2  -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an important option for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel plus carboplatin is the first‐line regimen for ovarian cancer NACT patients. However, the efficacy of NACT is controversial, how to improve the efficacy become an urgent problem to be solved in the treatment of ovarian cancer. It has been confirmed that the dose‐intensive paclitaxel combined carboplatin regimen can improve the prognosis in Asian patients with advanced ovarian cancer. However, this protocol has a low rate of complete tumor remission after NACT (4%) with toxicities and high probability of severe hypersensitivity reactions. Albumin‐bound paclitaxel has the characteristics of tumor targeting, low allergenicity. We propose that dose‐dense albumin‐bound paclitaxel (ddnab‐paclitaxel) (100 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15) combined with carboplatin (AUC = 5 days 1, 4 weeks) regimen may be superior to the paclitaxel plus carboplatin regimen. We conducted this Phase II randomized controlled study to testify the efficacy of dd‐nab paclitaxel. 57 stage IIIC‐IV patients with high‐grade epithelial, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer who are unable to undergo optimal cytoreduction and receive NACT after tumor biopsy will be recruited. The regimen for the study group is albumin‐bound paclitaxel (100 mg/m2, days 1, 8, and 15 doses) combined with carboplatin (AUC = 5 day 1, 4 weeks), while patients in the control group use paclitaxel (175 mg/m2, day 1) combined with carboplatin (AUC=6, day1). Interval debulking surgery(IDS) will be performed within 3‐4 weeks after 3 cycles of NACT. The primary endpoint is the proportion of Chemotherapy Response Score (CRS) of 3 according to the CRS system. The secondary endpoints are progression‐free survival(PFS), overall survival(OS) and the rates of complete resection and adverse events(AEs).

N2  -  Background Granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (GM‐CSF) stimulates immunity via recruitment of antigen presenting cells and tumor specific T‐cell stimulation. Albumin‐bound paclitaxel (nab‐paclitaxel) followed by GM‐CSF may enhance antitumor responses and prolong remissions in ovarian cancer. Immune phenotypes present before treatment may identify responders to chemo‐immunotherapy. Methods Recurrent platinum‐resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer patients received nab‐paclitaxel, 100 mg/m2 days 1, 8, 15 followed by GM‐CSF 250 μg days 16–26 every 28 days for 6 planned cycles. The primary endpoint was remission duration compared to immediate prior remission. Peripheral blood was evaluated by flow cytometry and interferon‐γ ELISPOT. Results Twenty‐one patients were enrolled. Six patients (29%) achieved a biochemical complete response and 9 (43%) a partial response for an overall response rate of 72%. Median time to progression was 4 months and 10% of patients achieved longer remissions than the immediate prior regimen. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.8 months. Fewer myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) at enrollment significantly associated with complete response (p = 0.05). T‐cell responses to IGF1R‐p1332–1346 (r = 0.827, p = 0.0003) and IGF1R‐p1242–1256 (r = 0.850, p = 0.0001) during treatment correlated with time to progression. Conclusions Nab‐paclitaxel combined with GM‐CSF demonstrated biochemical responses in a majority of patients, although responses were not sustained. This combination did not demonstrate an advantage in OS over prior studies of nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. Agents that modulate MDSC should be studied as potential adjuvants to therapy. Strategies to expand T cells recognizing tumor‐associated antigens biologically significant in ovarian cancer should also continue to be investigated.

N2  -  Background: Nanoparticles hold considerable promise for aerosol‐based IP delivery in patients with carcinomatosis. Recently, results from preclinical experiments suggested that Nab‐PTX (Abraxane®) may result in superior efficacy in the treatment of PM compared to the standard Sb‐PTX formulation (Taxol®). Here, we present a phase I trial of PIPAC using Nab‐PTX in patients with upper gastrointestinal, breast, or ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods: Eligible patients with advanced, biopsy‐proven PM from ovarian, breast, gastric, hepatobiliary, or pancreatic origin underwent three PIPAC treatments using Nab‐PTX with a four‐week interval. The dose of Nab‐PTX was escalated from 35 to 140 mg/m2 using a Bayesian approach until the MTD was determined. Secondary endpoints included surgical morbidity, non‐access rate, PK analyses, QoL, OS, and treatment response. Results: No DLT was observed in any of the five dose groups. Grade 3 thrombopenia was observed in one patient allocated to a dose of 90 mg/m2. One patient allocated to the highest dose experienced grade 3 neutropenia one week after each PIPAC. Both thrombopenia and neutropenia recovered spontaneously. The most frequent treatment‐related toxicities were liver toxicity (grade 1 to 3, 75%) and anemia (grade 1 to 3, 70%). Remarkably, eight patients (40%; n=1 at 35 mg/m2, n=1 at 90 mg/m2, n=1 at 112.5 mg/m2, n=5 at 140 mg/m2) showed surgical site infections including wound infection and wound dehiscence (grade 1 to 3), four of whom required treatment with antibiotics. After PIPAC with Nab‐PTX, seven (35%) responders, six (30%) non‐responders and seven (35%) patients with stable PM were found. Thirteen (65%) patients combined PIPAC therapy with systemic chemotherapy. Conclusions: PIPAC with Nab‐PTX may be applied safely up to a dose of 140 mg/m2 and in combination with systemic chemotherapy. However, at the MTD of 140 mg/m2, considerable surgical site infections and liver toxicity were observed. Therefore, the recommended dose for future phase II trials is 112.5 mg/m2. Trial registration: This clinical trial was registered in the www.clinicaltrials.gov system as NCT03304210 on 6 October 2017.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Bevacizumab combined with Albumin‐bound paclitaxel chemotherapy for patients with platinum‐resistant recurrent or metastatic ovarian cancer. METHODS: A total of 58 patients were confirmed ovarian cancer by surgery during September 2010 to October 2013, these patients had postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with platinum‐based regimens and they were stable disease during the chemotherapy but had recurrence within six months. The 58 patients were separated into two groups, 28 patients received Bevacizumab combined with albumin bound paclitaxel chemotherapy regimen(combined group), ab‐paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 given on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 days cycle with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 15.The other 30 patients received ab‐paclitaxel only 100mg/m2on days 1, 8 and 15(single group) of a 28 days cycle, The adverse reactions and efficacy were evaluated after treatment. The patients were followed‐up, and the survival was analyzed. RESULTS: The objective response rates of combined group and single group were respectively 53.57%(15/28) and 36.67%(11/30)(P=0.025, χ2=3.425). The median progression‐free survival was 8.9 months and 6.6 months(χ2=11.892, P=0.001). The median overall survival was 16.8 months and 15.6 months (χ2=5.376, P=0.02). The specific toxicities of combined group was hypertension(14.28%), haemorrhage (10.71%), proteinuria(10.71%) within I‐II grade, these adverse reactions could be controlled after medication. The most frequent adverse reactions of the both groups were myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions, the grade III‐IV myelosuppression occurred in the two groups, but it had no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab with Ab‐paclitaxel has antitumor activity with manageable side effects in patients with platinum resistant recurrent or metastatic ovarian carcinoma, and it can prolong survival time compared with the single group, This regimen has good clinical application prospects.

N2  -  To observe the clinical efficacy of bevacizumab combined with albumin‐conjugated paclitaxel in the treatment of platinum‐resistant, relapsed and metastatic ovarian cancer, 70 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer were divided into observation group and control group by random number table. The control group received only albumin‐binding paclitaxel monotherapy (d 1, d 8, d 15). The observation group was treated with bevacizumab based on the treatment of the control group. The clinical efficacy, adverse reactions and quality of life of patients, immune function of two groups were observed and compared.6 cycles of chemotherapy were successfully completed in both groups. The ORR of the observation group was 57.1% (20/35), which was not significantly different from that of the control group (48.6%, 17/35) (χ2=0.516, P>0.05).The total clinical benefit rate of the observation group was 94.3% (33/35), which was significantly higher than that of the control group (77.1%, 27/35) (χ2=4.200, P<0.05).The median PFS was 8.9 months for the observation group and 16.2 months for the median OS.The median PFS was 6.8 months for the control group and 14.8 months for the median OS. The median PFS and median OS in the observation group were significantly longer than in the control group (χ2=12.563, 10.628, P<0.01).The improvement rate of quality of life in the observation group was 77.1%(27/35), which was significantly higher than that of the control group (45.7%, 16/35) (χ2=7.295, P<0.01).There were no significant differences in immune function and adverse reactions between the observation group and the control group (P>0.05). Bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel in combination with paclitaxel has better clinical effect in the treatment of platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer with recurrence and metastasis. It is better than single‐agent chemotherapy in survival of patients and better tolerability, and has good clinical application.

N2  -  One of the major challenges related to solvent‐based taxanes administration in clinical practice is the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Nab‐paclitaxel is a solvent‐free, albumin‐bound, paclitaxel, which minimize the risk of HSR occurrence. In this single‐institution, retrospective analysis, we evaluated stage IIIc‐IV epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, treated with first‐line carboplatin/nab‐paclitaxel (+/‐ bevacizumab), after the occurrence of an HSR with solvent‐based paclitaxel (and/or docetaxel). Between April 2012 and December 2018, ten patients (20.8%) received carboplatin/nab‐paclitaxel (+/‐ bevacizumab) after the occurrence of an HSR to solvent‐based taxanes. Among the evaluable patients, ORR was 100%. At median follow‐up of 28.5 months, median PFS was 16.7 months, and median OS was 65.4 months, respectively. Median received dose intensity (DI) was 86% and 80% of the projected DI for nab‐paclitaxel and carboplatin, respectively. There were no treatment‐related grade 4 adverse events. Most relevant treatment‐related grade 3 adverse events were: asthenia (10%), hypertransaminasemia (10%), neutropenia (20%), thrombocytopenia (20%), and anemia (10%). No HSR recurrence was observed. The high rate of HSR occurrence could limit first‐line treatment options in clinical practice. Carboplatin/nab‐paclitaxel association could represent a valid treatment option in this setting.

N2  -  ABI 007 is an albumin‐stabilised nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel designed to overcome insolubility problems encountered with paclitaxel. This then eliminates the need for toxic solvents like cremophor, which limits the dose of paclitaxel that can be administered and hence effect overall drug efficacy. ABI 007 is being developed for the treatment of a variety of tumour types by American Pharmaceutical Partners. In addition to the standard infusion formulation of ABI 007, oral and pulmonary delivery formulations are also being investigated. American Pharmaceutical Partners, a subsidiary of American BioScience, secured exclusive North American marketing and manufacturing rights to ABI 007 from American BioScience in November 2001. American BioScience completed a phase III study in the US in metastatic breast cancer patients in early 2003. An indication for which ABI 007 was granted fast track status in January 2003. The phase III study directly compared the efficacy of ABI 007 260 mg/m(2) with paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2). Both agents were administered every 3 weeks. ABI 007 was administered as a 30‐minute infusion without steroid pretreatment. Paclitaxel‐treated patients received steroid pretreatment and the drug was administered over 3 hours. In October 2002, a Data Monitoring Committee concluded that a sample size adjustment of the phase III trial would not be required and that the study can be continued to completion. Enrolment was completed in December 2002 with 460 first‐ and second‐line metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled. The results were expected to be unblinded in mid‐2003. A phase II trial of ABI 007 is also underway in metastatic breast cancer patients who have failed taxane therapy. The trial is evaluating a weekly rather than 3‐weekly regimen of ABI 007. Earlier, in May 2003, American Pharmaceutical Partners reported that ABI 007 is also being evaluated for the treatment of non‐small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and cervical cancers. However, the phase of development for these indications remains unclear.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Abraxane (ABI‐007) is a 130‐nm albumin‐bound (nab) particle formulation of paclitaxel, devoid of any additional excipients. We hypothesized that this change in formulation alters the systemic disposition of paclitaxel compared with conventional solvent‐based formulations (sb‐paclitaxel; Taxol), and leads to improved tolerability of the drug. Patients and Methods: Patients with malignant solid tumors were randomized to receive the recommended single‐agent dose of nab‐paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) as a 30‐minute infusion) or sb‐paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) as a 3‐hour infusion). After cycle 1, patients crossed over to the alternate treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out for the first cycle of sb‐paclitaxel and the first two cycles of nab‐paclitaxel. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were treated, with 14 receiving at least one cycle each of nab‐paclitaxel and sb‐paclitaxel. No change in nab‐paclitaxel pharmacokinetics was found between the first and second cycles (P = 0.95), suggesting limited intrasubject variability. Total drug exposure was comparable between the two formulations (P = 0.55) despite the dose difference. However, exposure to unbound paclitaxel was significantly higher after nab‐paclitaxel administration, due to the increased free fraction (0.063 +/‐ 0.021 versus 0.024 +/‐ 0.009; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study shows that paclitaxel disposition is subject to considerable variability depending on the formulation used. Because systemic exposure to unbound paclitaxel is likely a driving force behind tumoral uptake, these findings explain, at least in part, previous observations that the administration of nab‐paclitaxel is associated with augmented antitumor efficacy compared with solvent‐based paclitaxel.

N2  -  Objective. This study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Methods. A total of 84 patients with platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma treated in our hospital from May 2017 to June 2018 were selected as the research objects. The patients were divided into observation group (n=42) and control group (n=42) according to random number table method. The observation group was treated with olaparib combined with bevacizumab, while the control group was treated with albumin‐bound paclitaxel combined with bevacizumab, and the clinical efficacy of the two groups was observed. The levels of serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), and epididymal protein 4 (HE4) were determined. The levels of miRNA124, mirNA‐21, and miRNA‐203 in the two groups were detected. The incidence of adverse reactions was compared between the two groups. The quality of life of the two groups was assessed using FACT‐G scale. The drug safety of the two groups was observed. All patients were followed up for 3 years, and the survival time of the two groups was recorded. The Kaplan‐Meier method was used to analyze the survival of the two groups. Results. The overall response rate (ORR) (69.05%) and disease control rate (DCR) (88.10%) of the observation group were higher than those of the control group (40.48% and 66.67%), and the differences were statistically significant (both P<0.05). After treatment, the levels of serum CA125, CA199, HE4, miRNA124, miRNA‐21, and miRNA‐203 and the improvement degree of quality of life score in the observation group were greater than those in the control group, with statistical significances (all P<0.05).The 1‐year, 2‐year, and 3‐year survival rates of the observation group (97.62%, 88.10%, and 80.95%) were higher than those of the control group (71.43%, 57.14%, and 47.62%), with statistical significances (all P>0.05). Conclusion. PARP inhibitor combined with bevacizumab had good effect in the treatment of platinum‐resistant recurrent ovarian epithelial carcinoma and can effectively improve the survival time and quality of life of patients.

N2  -  Introduction: LCL161 is a novel oral pan‐inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist. LCL161 enhances paclitaxel activity in cell lines and xenograft models. A phase I study of LCL161 combined with paclitaxel for the treatment of Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors was conducted. Methods: Each patient received oral LCL161 in a single weekly dose on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 21‐day treatment cycle. In the second cycle, patients received a combination treatment with weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) whenever possible. A Bayesian logistic regression model by escalation with the overdose control principle was used. Results: Nine patients were treated with LCL161 at a dose of 600 mg (five patients) or 1200 mg (four patients). Seven patients were treated with LCL161 plus paclitaxel, and two patients received only LCL161 monotherapy. Because this study was terminated early due to a change in the LCL161 development strategy, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not determined. One patient treated with LCL161 monotherapy at a dose of 1200 mg experienced dose limitind toxicity (grade 3 maculopapular rash). Another patient died on day 86 of bacterial pneumonia, which was suspected to be related to the study treatment. The most common serious adverse events were infections and infestations (n = 3). Conclusion: The present study suggests that the risk of infection may increase when LCL161 is combined with paclitaxel, but other conclusions about the MTD, pharmacokinetic profile, and preliminary activity of the combination of LCL161 plus paclitaxel were not drawn.

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: To assess the anti‐tumor activity and side effects of different dosages of paclitaxel (albumin binding type) (hereinafter referred to as nab‐P) combined with Apatinib (hereinafter referred to as AP) in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer cell line and xenograft models. METHODS: SKOV‐3/DDP cell line was selected as the research object in cytology experiment. Firstly, we divided it into three groups for experiments to explore the individual effects of nab‐P and AP. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): nab‐P group, nab‐P 40?µmol/l; c): AP group, AP 50?µmol/l (Drug doses were IC‐50 values that detected by MTT assay). Apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl‐2), vascular related protein(p‐VEGFR‐2), invasion related protein (MMP‐2) expression were detected by Western blot and Cellular immunofluorescence, the invasion ability of tumor cells were detected by Transwell and Cell scratch test. Based on these dates, secondly, establishing different doses of nab‐P combined with Ap to explore the curative effect of combination therapy. a): Control group, blank control, no drug intervention; b): Group‐1, nab‐P 5?µmol/l?+?AP 10?µmol/l, c): Group‐2, nab‐P 4.5?µmol/l?+?AP 10?µmol/l, d): Group‐3, nab‐P 4?µmol/l?+?AP 10?µmol/l, e): nab‐P group, nab‐P 5?µmol/l, f): AP group, AP 10?µmol/l (MTT assay). The combination index was analyzed by Compusyn software, Western blot, Immunofluescence, Transwell and Cell scratch test also were also chose to observe of inhibition effect. Thirdly, we used xenograft models to verify the results of cytological experiments. Tumor‐forming BALB/c female nude mice were randomly divided into 4 groups, a): Control group, no drug intervention, only saline injection, b): nab‐P 20?mg/kg?+?AP 150?mg/kg, c): nab‐P 18?mg/kg?+?AP 150?mg/kg, d): nab‐P 16?mg/kg?+?AP 150?mg/kg (The doses were guided by the pharmaceutical manufacturers). The tumor growth curve was analyzed during the experiment. And the apoptosis related protein (Bax, bcl‐2), angiogenesis related protein (CD31, p‐VEGFR‐2) and invasion related protein (MMP‐2) were observed by Western blot, Immunofluescence and Immunohistochemistry to analysis the ant‐tumor effects. The quality of life in nude mice were observed to analysed the drug‐induced side effects. CONCLUSION: nab‐P, a chemotherapeutic agent, can play an anti‐tumor role in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer, but it can cause adverse effects that increase with dose. When combined with AP, the two drugs have synergistic effect, which can improve the anti‐tumor effects of single drug. In addition, when combined with AP, the doses of nab‐P can be appropriately reduced under the standard of recommended to reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy drugs, without affecting the anti‐tumor effect. RESULT: In the separate medication section, (1) The IC‐50 value of nab‐P was 45.53?±?4.06?µmol/l, while the AP was 50.66?±?4.96 umol/L (48?h). (2) The expressions of bcl‐2 (nab‐P group, AP group), p‐VEGFR‐2 (AP group), MMP‐2(nab‐P group, AP group) were higher than Control group, while Bax (nab‐P group, AP group) lower (P <?0.01). (3) The cell invasive ability was decreased after the nab‐P and AP intervation (P?<?0.01). In the combination medication section, (1) Compusyn showed the Combination index (Cl) were all below 1 (Cl?<?1), that means nab‐P and AP are synergism. (2) The combination IC‐50 value was nab‐P 5.28?µmol/l?+?AP 10.56?µmol/l (48?h). (3) In the detection of related protein expression, the combination of drugs can improve the anti‐tumor effect, otherwise, after combined with AP, when nab‐P were reduced dose in proper quantity, there were no obvious different in drug effect. (4) After reducing the doses of nab‐P, the average food intake of nude mice increased from 4.50?g?±?0.17 to 5.55?g?±?0.13, and the one‐hour activity increased from 6.11?min ±0.16 to 6.34?min ±0.13.

N2  -  Objective Integral membrane protein 2A (ITM2A) is a type 2 transmembrane protein of unknown function. The aim of this study was to investigate its expression pattern, clinical significance, and biological function in epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods ITM2A expression in 35 normal, 20 adenoma, 11 borderline and 90 cancerous ovarian tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological parameters were obtained from medical records. Survival data was analyzed using Kaplan‐Meier estimates and multivariate analysis using the Cox‐regression method. Anti‐tumor activities of ITM2A were explored by cell proliferation and colony formation assays, flow cytometry, Western blots and animal studies using ovarian cancer cell lines. Chemoresponsiveness was evaluated by measuring IC50 and confirmed by animal studies using an intraperitoneal orthotropic model. Results ITM2A was significantly downregulated in invasive carcinomas compared to normal, adenoma and borderline tumor tissues. ITM2A loss occurred in 45.6% (41 of 90) of invasive carcinomas and was significantly associated with FIGO stage, type II tumors, suboptimal debulking operation, recurrence and chemoresistance. ITM2A loss and higher FIGO stage were independent factors for poor prognosis. Expression of ITM2A inhibited growth and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest by attenuating cdc2, cyclin B1, cdc25c and p‐cdc2 (Thr 161). In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that ITM2A expression significantly reduced the paclitaxel and carboplatin IC50 and tumor mass after paclitaxel treatment. Conclusion ITM2A is a new biomarker of poor prognosis in ovarian cancer. It is a novel tumor suppressor that induces cell cycle arrest, acts as a chemosensitizer, and has therapeutic potential for ovarian cancer.

N2  -  Bevacizumab has been found to prolong progression free survival in first line, and more recently, in second line treatment for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who had not received prior treatment with bevacizumab. Recently reported data suggest that patients with colon cancer who receive bevacizumab in more than one line of therapy (beyond progression) have better results. In ovarian cancer, the role of bevacizumab administered in both first and second‐line therapies needs to be defined. This study aims to evaluate whether administering bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in second‐line therapy to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received first‐line bevacizumab will be more effective than chemotherapy alone.

N2  -  Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer and the 5th leading cause ofcancer death in women. Platinum chemotherapy has been widely adopted as a standardtreatment for advanced ovarian cancer, the response rates in patients withrelapsed/refractory ovarian cancer is unacceptably low. PD‐1 blockade has been developedto a new class of cancer immunotherapy that could restore an adequate immunosurveillanceagainst the neoplasm and enhance T‐cell‐mediated anticancer immune responses. Manganesehas been confirmed to activate antigen‐presenting cells and function as mucosalimmunoadjuvants in pre‐clinical studies. This two‐arm, phase I/II study is designed toassess the safety and efficacy of combined therapy of anti‐PD‐1 antibody and chemotherapywith or without Manganese priming.

N2  -  The current standard treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer, tubal cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer is maximal cytoreductive surgery followed by intravenous chemotherapy with or without intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IP). Recently, the organizations of SGO and ASCO recommended that women with Fagotti score by laparoscopic exploration < 6 would benefit from primary cytoreductive surgery followed by postoperative chemotherapy, and are likely to attain optimal cytoreduction (residual lesion ≤ 1 cm). Hyperthermia promotes chemotherapy to penetrate deeper into the cancer tissue. Therefore, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as newly postoperative chemotherapy after primary cytoreductive surgery in the treatment of ovarian cancer could lead to higher response rate and better survival outcomes.

This study is to confirm previous results that showed oregovomab was able to help the body to produce an immune response to CA125 (a target that has been identified on ovarian cancer cells) in patients with stage III‐IV ovarian cancer when they were receiving chemotherapy for their disease. The primary aim of the study is to see how well these patients with advanced ovarian cancer make an immune response to CA125 by using a specific test (enzyme‐linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay) of the patient's blood. The study will also look at the side effects of the oregovomab, other immune response parameters, how well the patients respond to the treatment of their disease (how long it takes to show that their disease has progressed and how long these patients survive overall).

N2  -  BACKGROUND: No biomarker is available to predict prognosis of patients with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) and guide the choice of chemotherapy. We performed a prospective‐retrospective biomarker study within the MITO2 trial on the treatment of AOC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MITO2 is a randomised multicentre phase 3 trial conducted with 820 AOC patients assigned carboplatin/paclitaxel (carboplatin: AUC5, paclitaxel: 175 mg/m², every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) or carboplatin/PLD‐pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (carboplatin: AUC5, PLD: 30 mg/m², every 3 weeks for 6 cycles) as first line treatment. Sixteen biomarkers (pathways of adhesion/invasion, apoptosis, transcription regulation, metabolism, and DNA repair) were studied in 229 patients, in a tissue microarray. Progression‐free and overall survival were analysed with multivariable Cox model. RESULTS: After 72 months median follow‐up, 594 progressions and 426 deaths were reported; there was no significant difference between the two arms in the whole trial. No biomarker had significant prognostic value. Statistically significant interactions with treatment were found for DNA‐dependent protein kinase (DNA‐PK) and phosphorylated acetyl‐coenzymeA carboxylase (pACC), both predicting worse outcome for patients receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel. CONCLUSION: These data show that in presence of DNA‐PK or pACC overexpression, carboplatin/paclitaxel might be less effective than carboplatin/PLD as first line treatment of ovarian cancer patients. Further validation of these findings is warranted.

N2  -  The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of intraperitoneal tgDCC‐E1A that can be given in combination with paclitaxel as a treatment for patients with recurrent, platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer. How the cancer responds to this treatment will also be studied. Researchers will also ask the patients if they will allow additional tumor samples to be collected and extra blood samples to be drawn. These samples will be used to learn about the biological response before and after treatment.

N2  -  The standard first‐line treatment of ovarian cancer is combination chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel, given every 3 weeks. Researchers are looking at new ways of giving chemotherapy to make it more tolerable and more effective. One way is by giving the chemotherapy more often in smaller doses. This approach can be associated with fewer or less troubling side effects. Some chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel have been shown to also be more active when given once a week rather than once every 3 week schedule.

IM‐862 may kill tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and IM‐862 may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and IM‐862 in treating patients who have resected stage III ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

N2  -  Overall survival for patients with ovarian cancer (OC) has shown little improvement for decades meaning new therapeutic options are critical. OC comprises multiple histological subtypes, of which the most common and aggressive subtype is high‐grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). HGSOC is characterized by genomic structural variations with relatively few recurrent somatic mutations or dominantly acting oncogenes that can be targeted for the development of novel therapies. However, deregulation of pathways controlling homologous recombination (HR) and ribosome biogenesis has been observed in a high proportion of HGSOC, raising the possibility that targeting these basic cellular processes may provide improved patient outcomes. The poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has been approved to treat women with defects in HR due to germline BRCA mutations. Recent evidence demonstrated the efficacy of targeting ribosome biogenesis with the specific inhibitor of ribosomal RNA synthesis, CX‐5461 in v‐myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC)‐driven haematological and prostate cancers. CX‐5461 has now progressed to a phase I clinical trial in patients with haematological malignancies and phase I/II trial in breast cancer. Here we review the currently available targeted therapies for HGSOC and discuss the potential of targeting ribosome biogenesis as a novel therapeutic approach against HGSOC.

N2  -  Background: Platinum‐resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer has an abysmal prognosis with limited treatment options. Poly‐(ADP‐ribose)‐polymerase (PARP), angiogenesis, and immune checkpoint inhibitors might improve the outcomes of platinum‐resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer, but accurate patient selections for those therapies remain a significant clinical challenge. Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of biomarker‐driven combinatorial therapies of pamiparib, tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab‐paclitaxel in platinum‐resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer. Study Hypothesis: A precision medicine combination of PARP inhibitors, anti‐angiogenic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy will improve disease outcomes of platinum‐resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer by accounting for genomic and immunologic features. Trial Design: The BRIGHT Trial is a prospective, open‐label, multicenter, phase II, umbrella study planning to enroll 160 patients with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell platinum‐resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer from 11 clinical centers in China. Patients are assigned to one of three experimental arms based on biomarkers. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations will receive pamiparib plus bevacizumab (arm 1, n=40) regardless of CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes count. Patients with wild‐type BRCA1/2 (BRCAwt) and ≥3 CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive the combination of tislelizumab, bevacizumab, and nab‐paclitaxel (arm 2, n=50), while BRCAwt patients with <3 CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes count will receive bevacizumab plus dose‐dense nab‐paclitaxel (arm 3, n=50). After completing patient enrollment in arm 2, another 20 BRCAwt patients with ≥3 CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes count will be included as an arm 2 expansion. Treatment will continue until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, and all adverse events will be recorded. Major Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Eligible patients include those aged ≥18 with serous, endometrioid, or clear cell ovarian cancer, platinum‐resistant recurrence, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Primary Endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigators by the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Sample Size: 160 patients. Estimated Dates for Completing Accrual and Presenting Results: Recruitment is estimated to be completed by 2024 and results may be published by 2027. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05044871.

N2  -  The current standard of first‐line chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer is the combination of carboplatin AUC 5mg/mL/min and paclitaxel 175 mg.m‐². This combination is feasible in selected elderly patients such as those included in prospective trials. These trials, however, include a minority of the elderly population. In wider selection of patients >70 years old, the standard carboplatin‐paclitaxel regimen has been shown to induce an excess of toxicity and premature treatment stopping. For elderly patients thought to be vulnerable and at high risk of toxicity with the standard 3‐weekly carboplatin‐paclitaxel regimen, other options are used in routine practice. One option is to delete paclitaxel and treat elderly patients with carboplatin as a single agent. An alternative is to use the carboplatin‐paclitaxel regimen in a weekly schedule for both drugs such as reported by the MITO (Multicentre Italian Trial in Ovarian Cancer). To date, there is no randomized trial which could give us some evidence of how to select patients who could benefit most of one or the other regimen described above. The 4th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference has indeed recognised the medical unmet need of adapted therapy for elderly patients with ovarian cancer and the necessity of additional research in this population. Recently, GINECO has described a Geriatric Vulnerability Score (GVS) in a population of elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer included in a specific multicenter phase II trial. The best proportional hazard model fitting for overall survival identified the following geriatric covariates score as being poor survival risk factors: ADL score <6, IADL score <25, HADS score >14, albuminemia <35g/L and , lymphopenia <1G/L. GVS is the sum of these risk factors for each patient. Using a cut off of 3, the GVS identified a group of patients at high risk of severe toxicity, early cessation of treatment, unplanned hospitalization and adverse outcomes. This international multicentre randomized phase II trial will compare the success rate of delivering 6 courses of chemotherapy with evidence of efficacy and without premature termination for progression, death or unacceptable toxicity of three different chemotherapy regimens in a selected population of elderly patients with a GVS ≥ 3: ‐ Arm A: Paclitaxel 175mg/m²/3 hours, I.V. and carboplatin AUC 5, I.V. every 3 weeks ‐ Arm B: Carboplatin monotherapy AUC 5 or 6 every 3 weeks ‐ Arm C: Weekly paclitaxel 60 mg/m²/1 hour and weekly carboplatin AUC 2 (d1, d8, d15 every 4 weeks) The total number of patients to be enrolled is 240, ie 22 in each arm (total = 66) at the first step, then 58 more by arm (total=174) after interim analysis.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with paclitaxel plus AMG 386 is superior to paclitaxel plus placebo in women with recurrent partially platinum sensitive or resistant epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. AMG 386 is a man‐made medication that is designed to stop the development of blood vessels in cancer tissues. Cancer tissues rely on the development of new blood vessels, a process called angiogenesis, to obtain a supply of oxygen and nutrients to grow.

N2  -  Present research work is carried out to compare the clinical efficacy and adverse reactions between combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab and single medication of trastuzumab in treatment of ovarian cancer. A total of 80 recurrent ovarian cancer patients in Stage III B or IV confirmed by histopathological examination and/or cytological examination were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups, i.e. the combined medication group (n=37) and the single medication group (n=43). Patients in two groups underwent therapy for 4 cycles to evaluate the short‐term efficacy and adverse reactions of these two methods. The control rates of the combined medication group and the single medication group were 86.4% and 81.4%, respectively, while the partial response rates were 45.9% and 44.2%, respectively. As for the overall survival (OS), the OS in the single medication group was 7.0 months, while that in the combined medication group was 7.3 months (p=0.63). Incidence of neutropenia in the single and combined medication groups were respectively 51.2% and 40.5%, while the incidence rates of leukopenia in Stage III or IV were 44.2% and 24.3%, respectively (p<0.001) and the differences between two groups were statistically significant. Also, comparison of the incidence rates of thrombocytopenia between the single (53.5%) and combined (23.6%) medication groups showed statistical significance. With promising efficacy, few adverse reaction and high safety, combined medication of abraxane and trastuzumab is more applicable to the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.

N2  -  One of the major challenges related to solvent‐based taxanes administration in clinical practice is the high rate of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs). Nab‐paclitaxel has showed its considerable survival and low toxicity profiles in first‐line treatment for several solid tumors and is recommended as a treatment for recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We focus on clinical efficacy and safety outcomes of nab‐paclitaxel in current clinical studies of primary EOC treatment and aim to explore the potential feasibility of nab‐paclitaxel as the first‐line treatment for EOC, primary peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether patients with metastatic ovarian and non‐small cell lung cancer receiving carboplatin and paclitaxel have significantly fewer neuropathic events when treated with amifostine. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, parallel group, double blind, controlled study. Patients are randomized to either the amifostine or control group. All patients receive intravenous paclitaxel over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients who are randomized to the amifostine group receive intravenous amifostine administered as a 15 minute infusion 30 minutes prior to paclitaxel therapy. Patients randomized to the control group receive an intravenous placebo solution. Patients are discontinued from the study if they have disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects after 2 cycles of treatment. Patients are followed monthly for 8 months post treatment. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued (40 with advanced ovarian cancer and 40 with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer) within 2 years.

N2  -  Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy causing 41900 deaths annually in Europe. The predominance of aggressive Type II tumours, which are characterised by a high frequency of p53 mutations, and primary or acquired resistance to platinum‐based chemotherapy profoundly contribute to the high mortality rate. With current standard therapy the median overall survival of metastatic platinum‐resistant (Pt‐R) ovarian cancer patients is only 14 month. There is a pressing need for more effective, innovative treatment strategies to particularly improve survival in this subgroup of EOC patients. This is a drug strategy targeting a central driver of tumour aggressiveness and metastatic ability, namely mutant p53, via an innovative new Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibition mechanism. The most advanced, second‐generation Hsp90 inhibitor will be used, Ganetespib. The first part (Phase I) of the GANNET53 trial will test the safety of Ganetespib in a new combination with standard chemotherapy (Paclitaxel weekly) in Pt‐R EOC patients. The second part (randomised Phase II) will examine the efficacy of Ganetespib in combination with standard chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy alone in EOC patients with Pt‐R tumours.

N2  -  Background: TNBC patients with homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumors have significantly higher pathologic complete response (pCR, ypT0/is ypN0) rates when treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy. TILs are prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit in TNBC. Interestingly, recent data suggests that HR deficient TNBCs and BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancers may be enriched for immune cell infiltration. Thus, we performed a pooled analysis of 5 phase II studies that included patients with TNBC treated with neoadjuvant platinum‐based chemotherapy to evaluate the association of TILs with HR deficiency status and tumor BRCA1/2 mutation status. Methods: 166 patients with TNBC and known HR deficiency status from the following clinical trials were available for analysis: PrECOG 0105 (N=72), NCT00580333 (N=32), NCT01372579 (N=26), TBCRC 008 (N=18) and NCT00148694 (N=18). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens included 1) carboplatin, gemcitabine, iniparib, 2) cisplatin with or without bevacizumab 3) carboplatin, eribulin, 4) carboplatin, nab‐paclitaxel, with or without vorinostat. HR deficiency status was defined as a high HRD score (42 or higher) and/or presence of a BRCA1/2 tumor mutation (tBRCA). Digitized pre‐treatment core biopsy H&E sections were reviewed and scored by two blinded expert breast cancer pathologists using the international TIL working group guidelines. The density (%) of both intratumoral TILs (iTILs) and stromal TILs (sTILs) was recorded by deciles (n=122 thus far, additional cases to be included in final analysis). Results: Among 122 patients, pCR was achieved in 36 patients (29.5%) and 71 tumors (58.2%) were HR deficient. In total, 24 patients (19.7%) patients had a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation. Among all tumors, iTIL and sTIL median densities were 0% (range 0‐20) and 10% (range 0‐80), respectively, and were not statistically different in HR deficient versus non‐deficient tumors (iTIL p=0.746; sTIL p=0.159). The same absent association was observed for tBRCA mutation status (iTIL p=0.607; sTIL p=0.315) and binary HRD score (iTIL p=0.879; sTIL p=0.364). Updated results with additional cases scored for TILs will be reported at time of presentation. Additional analyses assessing the relationship between TILs and pCR/residual cancer burden adjusting for HRD status and other clinical variables will also be included at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Several previous studies have reported that TILs are significantly associated with response to standard chemotherapy regimens when given in the neoadjuvant setting. Measures of genomic instability and DNA repair deficiency, including HRD, have been shown to be robust predictors of response to chemotherapy, including platinum containing regimens. It is unclear if TILs will be predictive in a similarly robust way for response to platinum‐containing regimens. Results of this study suggest TIL density and HR deficiency status may be independent and non‐overlapping. Final analysis including additional cases will be included in the final presentation.

N2  -  The drug tested in this study was called alisertib. Alisertib was tested to treat people who have ovarian and breast cancer. This study looked at safety, any anti‐tumor effect, and it also determined a recommended dose of alisertib plus paclitaxel to take into further studies. Pharmacokinetic blood samples were studied to characterize any effects on the concentration of each of the drugs when administered together. The study enrolled 191 patients. Participants with Breast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer received one of the following escalating doses of alisertib in combination with paclitaxel in the Phase 1 lead‐in portion of the study: ‐ Alisertib 10 mg BID + Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 ‐ Alisertib 20 mg BID + Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 ‐ Alisertib 20 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 ‐ Alisertib 30 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 ‐ Alisertib 40 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 ‐ Alisertib 50 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/ recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined, participants were randomized to receive the following treatments in the Phase 2 portion of the study: ‐ Alisertib 40 mg BID + Paclitaxel 60 mg/m^2 ‐ Paclitaxel 80 mg/m^2 This multi‐center trial was conducted in the United States, Poland and France. The overall time to participate in this study was approximately 5 years. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and who did not experience disease progression (PD) were followed off‐treatment once every 8 weeks until the occurrence of 110 progression‐free survival (PFS) events.

N2  -  Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Relapse more than 6 months following first line chemotherapy is regarded as platinum/taxane sensitive disease. Reinduction chemotherapy with platinum/taxane is known to be an effective treatment option. Therapy induced anemia is a common problem resulting in decrease of quality of life. The rationale of this trail is to evaluate the effects of epoetin alpha on reduction of therapy induced anemia, rate of transfusions and on quality of life.

N2  -  RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor‐killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with bevacizumab is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab to see how well they work compared with carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and polyglutamate paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Paclitaxel and polyglutamate paclitaxel may also stop the growth of ovarian epithelial or peritoneal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Sometimes, after treatment, the tumor may not need additional treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient. It is not yet known whether paclitaxel is more effective than polyglutamate paclitaxel or observation only in treating ovarian epithelial, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Compare pathological response, recurrence‐free interval, and survival in patients with optimal stage III epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma receiving intravenous (IV) paclitaxel and cisplatin vs IV paclitaxel and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin plus IP paclitaxel. II. Compare the toxic effects and complications of these 2 treatment regimens in these patients. III. Determine the frequency and prognostic significance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in these patients. IV. Determine the effect of non‐genetic risk factors on the course of disease in BRCA1‐ and BRCA2‐related ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma. V. Compare the quality of life of these patients receiving these treatments. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to gross residual disease (present vs absent) and whether second‐look surgery will be performed at the end of treatment (yes vs no). Blood is drawn for BRCA mutation analysis and DNA extraction before the start of chemotherapy, but after randomization. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Patients in arm I receive IV paclitaxel by 24‐hour infusion on day 1 followed by IV cisplatin on day 2. Patients in arm II receive IV paclitaxel by 24‐hour infusion on day 1 followed by intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin on day 2, plus IP paclitaxel on day 8. Treatment for both arms repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 6 treatment courses. Following chemotherapy, second look surgery is performed if selected by the patient. Quality‐of‐life assessments are performed prior to randomization, prior to course 4, 3‐6 weeks after the completion of course 6 and prior to second look surgery if selected, 6 months after treatment is completed, and 12 months after treatment is completed. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 384 patients will be accrued for this study within 16 months.

N2  -  There are several data suggesting that pembrolizumab and bevacizumab may be synergistic. Enhanced tumor angiogenesis is commonly associated with absence of tumor‐infiltrating T cells in patients. There is evidence in OC that tumor expression of VEGF is negatively correlated to the density of CD3+TILs and this phenotype is associated with early recurrence, consistent with prior studies showing a correlation of VEGF to early recurrence and short survival. Furthermore, in ascites, high levels of VEGF correlate to low numbers of NK T‐like CD3+CD56+ cells This randomized phase II study aims to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combina‐tion with the standard neo adjuvant chemotherapy followed by IDS and the safety of this strategy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. We assume that its administration in the neo adjuvant setting combination with standard of care (4 cycles of standard chemotherapy) would improve the response rate and consequently will help to achieve optimal debulking rate at IDS. After surgery, patients will continue to be treated with standard of care (chemotherapy for 2 to 5 cycles plus or less bevacizumab) or the same combination plus pembrolizumab (keytruda).

N2  -  Epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, after lung, breast and colon cancer, and it represents the most common cause of death from gynaecological malignancies. The high mortality associated with OC is due to the lack of screening tests that enable an early diagnosis, thus the majority of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease when the chances of a cure are very limited. In fact, the 5‐year overall survival (OS) rate for stage III‐IV OC does not exceed 20‐30% in many series. The standard treatment for advanced OC is maximal cytoreductive surgery (or debulking) followed by the administration of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. In recent years, a number of studies have been carried out with antiangiogenic drugs. Specifically, bevacizumab, an anti‐VEGF monoclonal antibody, has been shown to be active both in monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with OC that have received multiple previous lines of chemotherapy. One of the objectives is to evaluate whether the addition of neoadjuvant bevacizumab improves the response and whether this affects the evolution of patients.

N2  -  Introduction/Background Single agent chemotherapies are commonly used in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer, but outcomes are generally poor. Cortisol, which acts by binding to the glu‐cocorticoid receptor (GR), can suppress apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. The GR is abundantly expressed in ovarian tumours and high GR expression is associated with poor outcomes. Data indicate that the selective GR modulator relacorilant can reverse cortisol's anti‐apoptotic effects, thereby enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinum‐refractory or platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer, intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), and a trend toward improved overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden compared to nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. This phase 3 study aims to confirm the findings of the phase 2 study in a larger patient population. Methodology ROSELLA (GOG‐3073, ENGOT‐Ov72/MITO, NCT05257408) is a randomised, phase 3, 2‐arm, open‐label study of relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel vs nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. Women with platinum‐resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1‐3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including prior bev‐acizumab, and at least 1 line of platinum‐based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinum‐refractory disease are excluded from the trial. Approximately 360 patients are being randomised 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab paclitaxel infusion) + nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab‐paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. Stratification factors are prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of world (North America vs. Europe vs. rest of world). Results The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, DoR, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacody‐namics, patient‐reported outcomes, and quality of life. Conclusion N/A.

N2  -  RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known which treatment regimen may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving one of two chemotherapy regimens containing carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel works in treating patients undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed primary stage IIIC or stage IV ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.

N2  -  Veliparib is an orally administered poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitor that is being studied in Phase I‐III clinical trials, including Phase III studies in non‐small‐cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer. Tumor cells with deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are deficient in homologous recombination DNA repair and are intrinsically sensitive to platinum therapy and poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitors. We describe herein the design and rationale of a Phase II trial investigating whether the addition of veliparib to temozolomide or carboplatin/paclitaxel provides clinical benefit over carboplatin/paclitaxel with placebo in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer harboring a deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutation (Trial registration: EudraCT 2011‐002913‐12, NCT01506609).

To compare the incidences of grade 2+ and grade 3+ TAXOL/CBDCA induced peripheral neuropathy measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) neuropathy scale between GSH and placebo arms. II. To compare the time to onset of grade 2+ and grade 3+ TAXOL/CBDCA induced peripheral neuropathy between GSH and placebo arms, measured by CTCAE neuropathy scale. III. To compare the proportion of patients requiring chemotherapy dose reductions secondary to TAXOL/CBDCA induced peripheral neuropathy between GSH and placebo arms. IV. To compare the proportion of patients stopping TAXOL/CBDCA secondary to peripheral neuropathy between GSH and placebo arms. V. To assess the toxicity profile of GSH in this situation. VI. To evaluate whether GSH influences the anti‐tumor activity of TAXOL/CBDCA. VII. To evaluate patient quality of life (QOL) measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian (FACT‐O) (ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer patients only) and patient daily symptom questionnaires over time between GSH and placebo arms. TERTIARY: I. To explore the association of genetic variations in genes involved in taxane/platinum metabolism with incidence of grade 2+ TAXOL/CBDCA induced peripheral neuropathy. II. As part of ongoing research for North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) studies, we are banking blood products for future studies. OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to baseline neuropathy (none vs grade 1), debulked status (no gross residual disease [no clinically apparent residual lesions at the completion of primary surgery] vs optimal [largest residual lesion < 1 cm at primary surgery] vs sub‐optimally debulked [residual lesion > 1 cm] or not operated upon), and cancer type (ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancers vs lung cancer vs other). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients are grouped based on, Planned paclitaxel dose cycle length (Weekly vs. every 3 weeks vs. every 4 weeks). The stratification factors listed include demographic, prognostic factors and medication that can potentially impact the primary or secondary outcomes, so they need to be distributed evenly among the two arms. The 18 level combinations involved in these four stratification factors are within the maximum recommended of one half of the group sample size for the study. Ideally, patients begin receiving glutathione before their first dose of chemotherapy, but must begin glutathione before their second dose of chemotherapy. ARM I: Patients receive glutathione intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes, paclitaxel* IV over 1 or 3 hours depending on planned dose cycle length and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 15 minutes, paclitaxel* IV over 1 or 3 hours depending on planned dose cycle length and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes. NOTE: *Alternatively, patients may receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and glutathione/placebo IV over 15 minutes weekly and carboplatin every 21 days for 12 weeks. Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacogenomic and other biomarker analyses. Patients complete questionnaires periodically, including quality‐of‐life assessments. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.

N2  -  Primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancer. However, three or four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) has been introduced in clinical setting because four randomized controlled trials related have shown a lower rate of complications in NAC followed by IDS despite the similar efficacy between PDS and NAC followed by IDS in advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancers. However, these trials have some limitations that the rate of optimal cytoreduction defined as the size of residual tumor <1 cm was about 40%, which was a disappointed result not showing the surgical effect improving survival. Nevertheless, more treatment strategies using NAC followed by IDS should be investigated because NAC followed by IDS has been already known as another standard treatment due to the safety. A recent meta‐analysis has reported that reduction of one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy may increase overall survival of 4.1 months because it can induce surgical resection of more visible tumors with drug‐resistant. Moreover, a related clinical trial has shown that hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may increase survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer who received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy because HIPEC can kill drug‐resistant invisible tumor cells which were not resected during IDS. Thus, the investigators designed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trial for comparing survival, clinical outcomes and quality of life between two and three cycles of NAC followed by IDS, and thereby will investigate the efficacy and safety of reduction of one cycle of NAC.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Compare progression‐free and overall survival of patients with drug‐sensitive, low‐volume ovarian cancer that is persistent following standard therapy treated with salvage therapy comprising standard‐dose paclitaxel and carboplatin vs high‐dose carboplatin, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow reconstitution. II. Compare the toxic effects of these two salvage regimens. III. Compare selected health‐related aspects of quality of life in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating center and disease state at reassessment laparotomy. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and carboplatin IV continuously on days 1‐5 every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses. Arm II: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days ‐8, ‐6, and ‐4, and carboplatin IV continuously on days ‐8 through ‐4, followed by rescue with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3 and 9 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 months for an additional 5 assessments regardless of disease progression. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients will be accrued over approximately 60 months.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Despite therapeutic advances, outcomes for patients with platinum‐resistant/refractory ovarian cancer remain poor. Selective glucocorticoid receptor modulation with relacorilant may restore chemosensitivity and enhance chemotherapy efficacy. METHODS: This three‐arm, randomized, controlled, open‐label phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03776812) enrolled women with recurrent, platinum‐resistant/refractory, high‐grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, or ovarian carcinosarcoma treated with ≤4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to (1) nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + intermittent relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab‐paclitaxel); (2) nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) + continuous relacorilant (100 mg once daily); or (3) nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Nab‐paclitaxel was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS) by investigator assessment; objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), and safety were secondary end points. RESULTS: A total of 178 women were randomly assigned. Intermittent relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66; log‐rank test P = .038; median follow‐up, 11.1 months) and DOR (HR, 0.36; P = .006) versus nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy, while ORR was similar across arms. At the preplanned OS analysis (median follow‐up, 22.5 months), the OS HR was 0.67 (P = .066) for the intermittent arm versus nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. Continuous relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel showed numerically improved median PFS but did not result in significant improvement over nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. Adverse events were comparable across study arms, with neutropenia, anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and fatigue/asthenia being the most common grade ≥3 adverse events. CONCLUSION: Intermittent relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel improved PFS, DOR, and OS compared with nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. On the basis of protocol‐prespecified Hochberg step‐up multiplicity adjustment, the primary end point did not reach statistical significance (P < .025). A phase III evaluation of this regimen is underway (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05257408).

N2  -  Background We conducted a phase III, non‐inferiority trial comparing upfront primary debulking surgery (PDS) and interval debulking surgery (IDS) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for stage III/IV ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers (JCOG0602). Two earlier studies, EORTC55971 and CHORUS, demonstrated non‐inferior survival of patients treated with NAC. However, they could not evaluate true treatment invasiveness because of adding diagnostic laparotomy or laparoscopy before treatment in over 30% of both arms of EORTC55971 and in 16% of NAC arm of CHORUS. Methods Patients were randomised into the standard arm (PDS followed by eight cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin [TC]) and NAC arm (four cycles of TC, IDS, and four cycles of TC). In the standard arm, IDS was optional for patients who had undergone suboptimal or incomplete PDS. Treatment invasiveness was compared between arms (UMIN000000523). Results Between November 2006 and October 2011, 301 patients were randomised. In the standard arm, 147/149 underwent PDS and 49 underwent IDS. In the NAC arm, 130/152 underwent IDS. The NAC arm required fewer surgeries (mean 0.86 versus 1.32, p < 0.001) and shorter total operation time (median 273 min versus 341 min, p < 0.001) than the standard arm and required a lower frequency of abdominal organ resection (23.7% versus 37.6%, p = 0.012) or distant metastases resection (3.9% versus 10.7%, p = 0.027). In the NAC arm IDS, blood/ascites loss was smaller (median 787 ml versus 3235 ml, p < 0.001) and albumin transfusion and G3/4 adverse events after surgery in total were less frequent (26.2% versus 58.5%, p < 0.001; 4.6% versus 15.0%, p = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that NAC treatment is less invasive than standard treatment. NAC treatment may become the new standard treatment for advanced ovarian cancer when non‐inferior survival is confirmed in the planned primary analysis in 2017.

N2  -  This phase I/II partially randomized trial studies the side effects and the best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given together with paclitaxel and carboplatin and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III‐IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together with paclitaxel and carboplatin may be a better treatment for epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the progression free survival of chemotherapy naive patients with stage IC‐IV ovarian epithelial cancer following initial surgery treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin versus docetaxel and carboplatin. II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival, overall response rate, and CA125 response in these patients after these regimens. IV. Determine the quality of life of these patients on these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by residual disease (none or microscopic vs macroscopic no greater than 2 cm vs or macroscopic greater than 2 cm), study center, FIGO stage (IC‐IV), performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), tumor grade (well‐defined vs moderately defined vs poorly defined/undifferentiated vs unknown), interval debulking intention (yes vs no vs randomized into OV06 trial), elevated CA125 prior to treatment (yes vs no), and primary peritoneal cancer (yes vs no). Patients may undergo interval debulking surgery within 4 weeks of the third course of chemotherapy, or following 6 courses of treatment. Patients undergoing interval debulking after 3 courses should resume chemotherapy within 3 weeks of surgery. Patients are randomized into one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, immediately followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour. Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour, immediately followed by carboplatin IV over 1 hour. Courses are repeated every 21 days. Treatment continues for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial or complete response may receive 3 additional courses of carboplatin alone thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to each treatment course, and then every 4 months for 2 years or until disease progression. Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1050 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.25 years.

N2  -  Background: Malignant peritoneal adhesion is a common complication and prognostic factor of ovarian cancer and other primary abdominal tumors. The incidence of peritoneal adhesion in advanced primary peritoneal tumor is 32‐56%, which has increased by more than 10 times in the recent decade. Malignant peritoneal adhesion is closely associated with the morbidity and mortality of malignant intestinal obstruction. The peritoneal adhesion may aggravates the abdominal symptoms and reduce quality of life. Further, the peritoneal adhesion may impede treatment of primary tumor, such as operation or chemotherapy, lead to a poor prognosis. Objective: This study aims to treat malignant peritoneal adhesion with the combination of antiangiogenic agent and chemotherapy, evaluate the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal antiangiogenic agent plus chemotherapy. As explosive endpoints, we will examination the expression of VEGF‐A in peritoneal cavity during the treatment.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the weekly paclitaxel regimen increases the time until first progression or death (progression‐free survival [PFS]) compared to the every‐3‐week paclitaxel regimen in women with primary stage II, III or IV epithelial ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the weekly paclitaxel increases the duration of overall survival compared to the every‐3‐week paclitaxel when combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. II. To compare the weekly paclitaxel to the every‐3‐week paclitaxel with respect to the incidence of severe or serious adverse events when it is combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. III. To compare the weekly paclitaxel to the every‐3‐week paclitaxel with respect to patients' self‐reported quality of life (QOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian (FACT‐O)‐Trial Outcome Index (TOI), when paclitaxel is combined with carboplatin with or without bevacizumab. (As of 02/08/2012, the QOL portion of this study is complete; patients enrolled after this date will not have QOL assessments) TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with progression‐free survival and toxicity in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer using genome wide association studies (GWAS).* II. To evaluate genomic signatures in tumor tissues which are predictive for patient survival in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal and fallopian tube cancer.* III. To evaluate the association between serum and plasma biomarkers and response to anti‐angiogenesis therapy in advanced stage epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer.* NOTE: *As of 02/08/2012, the translational research (TR) portion of this study is complete; patients enrolled after this date will not have TR specimens collected. IMAGING PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether larger changes in the tumor perfusion parameters from baseline timepoint (T0) to early‐therapy T2 are prognostic of higher progression‐free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months (PFS‐6) from enrollment in patients treated with weekly or every‐3‐week paclitaxel regimens, who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.*** IMAGING SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine whether larger changes in tumor perfusion parameters from baseline T0 to intermediate T1 and from T1 to T2 are prognostic of higher PFS‐6 in patients treated with weekly or every‐3‐week paclitaxel regimens, who are receiving carboplatin with or without bevacizumab.*** II. To determine whether larger changes in tumor perfusion parameters values from T0 to T1, T0 to T2, and T1 to T2 are prognostic of better overall survival in all treatment arms.*** III. To assess the association between changes in tumor perfusion parameters before and after chemotherapy initiation (T0 to T1) and subsequent best tumor response according to standard anatomic Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).*** IV. To assess the association between tumor perfusion parameters before chemotherapy and subsequent best tumor response according to RECIST, PFS‐6, and overall survival.*** V. To test the assumption that tumor perfusion parameters are reliable, user‐independent, and reproducible parameters of tumor microvascular characteristics; a subgroup of 15 patients will have repeat computed tomography (CT) perfusion studies at the intermediate T1 time point.*** NOTE: ***Patients enrolled after February 8, 2012 must participate in the ACRIN 6695 component at ACRIN‐qualified institutions. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (beginning on 04‐30‐2012, the trial is no longer randomized and the chemotherapy regimen is selected and declared prior to enrolling in the study). ARM I (adjuvant chemotherapy suboptimally debulked): Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. ARM II (neoadjuvant chemotherapy with interval cytoreductive surgery): Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Patients undergo interval cytoreductive surgery between courses 3 and 4. Patients in both arms may receive optional** bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1 beginning in course 2. Courses of bevacizumab repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in Arm II receive bevacizumab during courses 2, 5, and 6 only. NOTE: **Before enrolling onto this study, each patient chooses whether the study treatment will include concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

N2  -  Objectives: Platinum resistance occurs in virtually all patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Single‐agent chemotherapies are commonly used in this setting, but outcomes are generally poor, leaving a large unmet need for novel, targeted treatments. Cortisol, which acts by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), can reduce the efficacy of chemotherapies by suppressing the apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. The GR is abundantly expressed in ovarian tumors, and high GR expression is associated with poor outcomes. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that modulation of GR signaling with relacorilant, a selective GR modulator, can reverse the antiapoptotic effects of cortisol, thereby enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase II study in patients with recurrent, platinum‐refractory or platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer, intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS), duration of response, and a trend towards improved overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden compared to nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. This phase III study aims to confirm the findings of the phase II study in a larger patient population. Methods: ROSELLA (GOG‐3073, ENGOT‐Ov72/MITO, ) is a phase III, randomized, 2‐arm, open‐label study of relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel compared to nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with recurrent, platinum‐resistant, high‐grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The study is being conducted at multiple sites globally. Approximately 360 patients are being randomized 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nab‐paclitaxel infusion) + nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2). Across both arms, nab‐paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. Stratification factors are prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of the world (North America vs Europe vs rest of world). Women with platinum‐resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1–3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including prior bevacizumab, and at least 1 line of platinum‐based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinum‐refractory disease are excluded from the trial. The primary endpoint is PFS assessed by a blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, patient‐reported outcomes, and quality of life.

N2  -  Purpose To establish a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the oral smoothened inhibitor sonidegib in combination with paclitaxel; secondary objectives include evaluation of safety, tolerability, markers of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and preliminary antitumor activity. Methods Patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in cohorts of escalating sonidegib dose levels (400mg, 600mg and 800mg orally, once daily on days 1–28) in combination with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 in 4‐weekly cycles. Dose‐limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed using CTCAE v4. Once the RP2D was defined, patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma were treated at this dose level in an expansion phase. Biomarkers of Hh signaling were assessed by immunohistochemistry in archival tissue and antitumor activity evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Results 18 patients were treated: 3 at 400 mg, 3 at 600 mg and 12 at 800 mg sonidegib. Only one patient treated at 800 mg presented a DLT (prolonged neutropenia resulting in failure to receive 75% of the planned sonidegib dose). However, 4 of 12 patients treated at 800 mg had their sonidegib dose reduced for toxicity after cycle 1. Hh biomarker (SHH, Patched, SMO and GLI1) staining did not correlate with clinical activity. Best response was partial response in 3 patients (2 ovarian, 1 breast cancer) and stable disease >4 cycles in 3 patients (2 ovarian, 1 anal cancer). Conclusions The combination of sonidegib and paclitaxel is tolerable and evidence of antitumor activity was identified. The RP2D of sonidegib was 800 mg in combination with paclitaxel 80mg/m2.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if one or both of the proposed intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens improves the progression‐free survival (PFS) event rate compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy for first‐line treatment of patients diagnosed with advanced stage ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. II. If both intraperitoneal (IP) regimens significantly improve the PFS event rate compared to the standard regimen, then a second study objective is to determine whether IP cisplatin and intravenous (IV) paclitaxel on day one plus IP paclitaxel on day eight improves the PFS event rate when compared to the IP carboplatin and IV paclitaxel. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if intraperitoneal chemotherapy reduces the overall death rate compared to standard intravenous chemotherapy. II. To assess the frequency and severity of adverse events as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. III. To compare the patient‐reported outcomes on: Quality of Life (Function Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian‐Trial Outcome Index [FACT‐O‐TOI]), Neuropathy (FACT‐Gynecologic Oncology Group/Neurotoxicity [GOG/NTX4] scale), Abdominal discomfort (FACT‐GOG/AD scale), Fatigue (FACIT‐Fatigue scale), and Nausea (item from FACT‐O‐TOI). IV. To assess the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study treatments. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and examine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression‐free survival and adverse events. II. To bank archival tumor for research and examine the association between tumor markers and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression‐free survival and adverse events. III. Patients will be encouraged to enroll on the companion translational research protocol (CEM0703 under development). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1 in courses 2‐6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone in courses 7‐22 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in Arm I and carboplatin IP on day 1. Patients also receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as in Arm I. ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin IP on day 2, and paclitaxel IP on day 8. Patients also receive bevacizumab as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive bevacizumab alone as in Arm I. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

N2  -  Selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulators (SGRMs) represent a clinically validated mechanism of enhancing chemosensitivity and ameliorating the sequelae of hypercortisolism. While GRs reportedly control the expression of up to 20% of the human genome, specific targets of systemic GR antagonism in humans have yet to be identified. To address this question, we established a robust NanoString assay to measure candidate GR target genes in human blood and assessed them before and after therapy with the oral SGRM relacorilant, which selectively antagonizes the GR. In a randomized, controlled phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinumresistant ovarian cancer (NCT03776812), gene changes were assessed in 139 patients after treatment with relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel (NP) or NP alone. Using cross‐validated random forest methods, a gene panel that accurately identified patients who had received relacorilant was established (ROC AUC 0.945 +/‐ 0.038). In 13 patients who crossed over from NP alone to relacorilant + NP, the genes in the panel were modified only after crossover (paired t‐test P=0.0003), validating the gene panel's ability to detect GR activity. The 4 most induced (LILRB4, FPR3, CLEC10A, CCR2) and 4 most suppressed (CDKN1C, TNFRSF17, BRIP1, PDK1) genes by relacorilant + NP vs. NP alone were selected and shown to be reliable indicators of GR activity across clinical studies in patients with pancreatic, prostate, and other solid tumors (NCT04329949, NCT03674814, NCT02762981), independent of concomitant medications or other confounders. CLEC10A (C‐type lectin domain containing 10A) was identified as a particularly sensitive marker of GR activity as its expression was strongly suppressed by the GR agonist prednisone in healthy volunteers (paired t‐test P<0.00010, NCT03335956) and strongly induced by relacorilant in patients with solid tumors (paired t‐test P<0.00010). CLEC10A induction in blood by relacorilant was associated with longer overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer treated with relacorilant + NP (HR=0.39, Cox PH P=0.0135). High baseline tumor CLEC10A expression was also associated with longer overall survival in a large tumor 'omics' database (N=1656 ovarian tumors; HR 0.8, log‐rank P=0.0008). CLEC10A and the genes correlated with its expression were found to be primarily expressed by a specific subset of dendritic cells, supporting previous reports that GR agonism can suppress dendritic cells. This analysis of CLEC10A and other identified GR target genes confirmed that systemic GR activity in patients with a range of solid tumors can be modulated pharmacologically, indicates that GR modulation may be associated with survival in patients with ovarian cancer, and provides new insights into the systemic functions of the GR in humans.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effect of continuing paclitaxel for 12 months versus 3 months on progression free survival and overall survival in women with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer who attained complete remission on initial platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) and paclitaxel based chemotherapy. II. Assess the toxic effects associated with prolonged paclitaxel administration in these patients. OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by stage (optimal stage III vs suboptimal stage III vs stage IV), prior treatments with paclitaxel (over at least 24 hours vs over less than 24 hours), and age (65 and under vs over 65). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or 1 year from registration, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 450 patients (225 per arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer has the highest mortality among gynecologic cancers, primarily because it typically is diagnosed at a late stage and because of the development of chemoresistance in recurrent disease. Improving outcomes in women with platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer is a substantial unmet need. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by cortisol has been shown to suppress the apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents, limiting their efficacy. Selective GR modulation may be able to counteract cortisol's antiapoptotic effects, enhancing chemotherapy's efficacy. A previous phase 2 study has shown that adding intermittently dosed relacorilant, a selective GR modulator, to nab‐paclitaxel improved outcomes, including progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with minimal added toxicity, in women with recurrent platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer. The ROSELLA study aims to confirm and expand on these findings in a larger population. METHODS: ROSELLA is a phase 3, randomized, 2‐arm, open‐label, global multicenter study in women with recurrent, platinum‐resistant, high‐grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Eligible participants have received 1 to 3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy, including ≥1 prior line of platinum therapy and prior treatment with bevacizumab, with documented progressive disease or intolerance to the most recent therapy. There is no biomarker‐based requirement for participant selection. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive intermittently dosed relacorilant in combination with nab‐paclitaxel or nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary efficacy endpoints include OS, investigator‐assessed PFS, objective response rate, best overall response, duration of response, clinical benefit rate at 24 weeks, and cancer antigen 125 response. The study is also evaluating safety and patient‐reported outcomes.

N2  -  PAST PRE‐CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE: The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in vitro and in vivo ovarian carcinoma pre‐clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in combination with chemotherapies. TTFields have been demonstrated to act synergistically with taxanes and have been shown to be additive when combined with other chemotherapies. In addition, TTFields have shown to inhibit metastatic spread of malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment. In a pilot study, 31 patients with recurrent platinum‐resistant ovarian carcinoma received paclitaxel together with TTFields (200 kHz) applied to the abdomen/pelvis until disease progression. The combination was well tolerated and the only device‐related adverse event was contact dermatitis. In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life, and activity within the brain (14% response rate). Finally, a phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life. DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL: All patients included in this trial are patients with platinum‐resistant ovarian carcinoma. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1. Patients receive TTFields at 200 kHz to the abdomen and pelvis using the NovoTTF‐100L(O) System together with weekly paclitaxel. 2. Patients receive weekly paclitaxel alone. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients enrolled in both arms. If assigned to the NovoTTF‐100L(O) group, the patients will be treated continuously with the device until progression in the abdomen/pelvis. On both arms, patients who have progression outside the abdomen/pelvis will switch to a second line treatment according to local practice. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND: Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet. Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (200 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating. The finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause electrically‐charged cellular components of these cells to change their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular components since they are electrically‐charged as well. As a result of these two effects, tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous exposure to TTFields. Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally dividing cells in healthy tissues. In conclusion, TTFields could potentially become treatment for ovarian cancer with very few side effects.

N2  -  ICON8 is a three‐arm, three stage trial. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients in arm 1 (control arm) will receive weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel on day 1 of a 21‐day cycle for 6 cycles. Patients in arm 2 will receive carboplatin on day 1 and dose‐fractionated weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21‐day cycle for 6 cycles. Patients in arm 3 will receive dose‐fractionated weekly carboplatin and dose‐fractionated weekly paclitaxel on day 1, 8 and 15 of a 21‐day cycle for 6 cycles. The trial will have three planned stages. Stage 1 will be conducted to confirm feasibility and safety of protocol treatment in all patients and separately in the Delayed Primary Surgery (DPS) patients. The outcome measure for stage 2 will be 9‐month progression‐free survival (PFS) rate. The primary outcome measures for stage 3 will be PFS and overall survival and secondary outcomes will be toxicity, Quality of Life and Health Economics. If pre‐defined levels of deliverability, at stage 1, or activity, at stage 2, are not met then the research arms will be reconsidered.

N2  -  Background: Cortisol activity at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) contributes to chemotherapy resistance by suppressing apoptotic pathways that taxanes utilize, and high tumor GR expression is associated with poor chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer. A phase 2 ovarian cancer study (NCT03776812) demonstrated the clinical benefit of adding relacorilant (RELA), a selective GR modulator, to nab‐paclitaxel (NP) compared to NP alone. We present biomarker analyses from this study. Methods: A phase 2, open‐label, randomized study of RELA in combination with NP compared with NP alone was conducted in patients with ovarian cancer. 127 formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded tumor samples collected as part of the study were analyzed using a CLIA‐validated GR immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. RNA expression was measured in whole blood using a custom NanoStringTM panel focused on GR target genes. Results: Tumor GR expression (IHC H‐score >0) was observed in 96% (122/127) of tumor samples. High tumor GR expression (H‐score ≥100) was observed in 65% (82/127) of samples and associated with non‐response to NP‐only (stable or progressive disease). In contrast, high GR expression was associated with good response (partial or complete response) in patients receiving RELA + NP (χ2P= 0.037). Subjects with low baseline plasma TGF‐β1 (<30,000 pg/mL) treated with RELA + NP had significantly longer overall survival (OS) compared to those with high TGF‐β1 (P<0.0001). Of 239 genes previously shown to be GR target genes, 221 were suppressed after RELA + NP treatment. Significantly fewer GR target genes were suppressed by NP (P<0.00001). GR target genes that were suppressed by RELA + NP but not NP alone included SGK1 (P=0.013), PIK3CG (P=0.018), and GSK3B (P=0.05). Conclusions: GR expression was abundant in the ovarian tumors assessed in this study. High GR expression was associated with poor outcomes in patients treated with NP alone. In contrast, high baseline tumor GR expression was associated with good response in patients treated with RELA + NP. Low plasma TGF‐β1 predicted longer OS. Suppression of GR‐target genes indicated systemic GR antagonism by RELA. Clinical trial identification: NCT03776812.

N2  -  This randomized phase II trial studies paclitaxel and carboplatin to see how well they work compared with bleomycin sulfate, etoposide phosphate, and cisplatin in treating patients with sex cord‐ovarian stromal tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced) or has returned (recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating sex cord‐ovarian stromal tumors.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab to 6 cycles of standard therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) (Arm II) increases the duration of progression‐free survival (PFS) when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy alone (Arm I) in women with newly diagnosed stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. II. To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab plus extended bevacizumab for 16 cycles beyond the 6 cycles of standard therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) (Arm III) increases progression‐free survival when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy (Arm I) in women with newly diagnosed stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. In the event that both Arm II and Arm III regimens are superior to the Arm I regimen with respect to progression‐free survival, to determine whether the Arm III regimen prolongs progression‐free survival when compared to the Arm II regimen. II. To determine whether the Arm II or Arm III regimen increases the duration of overall survival when compared with the Arm I regimen. III. To compare each of the experimental regimens to the Arm I regimen with respect to the incidence of severe toxicities or serious adverse events. IV. To determine the impact on Quality of Life (QOL, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian [FACT‐O] trial outcome index [TOI]) following treatment with the above regimens. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the relationship between angiogenic markers and clinical outcome including tumor response, progression‐free survival and overall survival in patients randomized to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) without bevacizumab, with concurrent bevacizumab or with extended bevacizumab. II. To assess the predictive value of a set of genes whose expression correlates with survival of patients with stage III (with any gross residual disease) and stage IV, epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. III. To bank whole blood for research. IV. To determine if genetic variations in genes associated with essential hypertension including WNK lysine deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1), G protein‐coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) and kallikrein B (KLKB1) predict which patients are likely to develop bevacizumab‐induced hypertension. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive placebo IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Beginning in course 7, patients receive placebo alone IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with placebo repeats every 21 days for up to 22 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Beginning in course 7, patients receive placebo alone IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with placebo repeats every 21 days for up to 22 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. ARM III: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1.

N2  -  Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of relacorilant either administered daily (continuous) or on the day prior, the day of, and the day after chemotherapy (intermittent) in combination with nab‐paclitaxel in the treatment of platinum‐resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers compared with nab‐paclitaxel alone. The safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic profile of relacorilant in combination with nab‐paclitaxel will also be assessed. Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following three treatment arms. Patient randomization will be stratified by treatment‐free interval from most recent taxane (relapsed within 6 months vs >6 months) and presence of ascites (yes vs no). ‐ Arm A (Continuous relacorilant): Relacorilant starting at 100mg, administered orally, once daily every day in combination with nab‐paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. ‐ Arm B (Intermittent relacorilant): Relacorilant 150mg, administered orally, on the day before (excluding Cycle 1, Day ‐1), the day of, and the day after nab‐paclitaxel, in combination with nab‐paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. ‐ Arm C (Comparator): Nab‐paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. Patients will remain on study treatment until reaching a protocol‐defined event of disease progression (PD), experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for progression, subsequent therapies and survival. Patients in Arm C who experience unequivocal PD per RECIST v1.1 will be given the opportunity to receive relacorilant in combination with nab‐paclitaxel after discussion with the Medical Monitor.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: ‐ Compare progression free survival and overall survival in patients with stage IIB, III, or IV invasive ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin with or without epirubicin. ‐ Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these patients. ‐ Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these 2 regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center and type of surgery (delayed surgery: 3 courses of chemotherapy before surgery vs primary surgery: optimally debulked stage IIB or III [residual tumor less than 1 cm] vs primary surgery: suboptimally debulked stage IV [residual tumor 1 cm or greater]). Surgery ‐ Patients are assigned to one of two surgery groups: ‐ Group A: Patients undergo primary surgery comprised of hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy (BSO), omentectomy, and resection of all tumor masses, if possible, before beginning chemotherapy. Patients with residual disease greater than 1 cm after completion of primary surgery receive 3 courses of chemotherapy, followed within 6 weeks by interval debulking surgery, followed within 3 weeks by the fourth course of chemotherapy. ‐ Group B: Patients undergo delayed surgery comprised of hysterectomy, BSO, omentectomy, and resection of all tumor masses, if possible, after completion of 3 courses of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy ‐ Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 chemotherapy arms: ‐ Arm I: Patients receive epirubicin IV over 15‐20 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients with residual tumor after completion of 6 courses may receive 3 additional courses. ‐ Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as above but no epirubicin. Quality of life is assessed before beginning study, after completion of courses 3, 6, and 9 (if applicable), and then at 6 and 12 months after completion of study treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.

N2  -  Background: Therapy options for patients with recurrent, platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer are limited. Cortisol contributes to chemotherapy resistance, one driver of poor outcomes, by suppressing apoptotic pathways used by cytotoxic agents. A phase 2 study of relacorilant (RELA) + nab‐paclitaxel (NP) in patients with ovarian cancer has shown that glucocorticoid receptor modulation with RELA can improve the efficacy of NP. In all patients, intermittent RELA + NP significantly improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and improved overall survival (OS) without additional side‐effect burden. We present results in the subgroup mirroring the patient population of an upcoming phase 3 study. Methods: 178 women with recurrent, platinum‐resistant/refractory, high‐grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with ≤4 prior lines of chemotherapy were enrolled in a phase 2, open‐label, randomized study of 2 RELA dosing schedules + NP vs NP alone (NCT03776812). The subgroup of patients without primary platinum‐refractory disease and with 1‐3 prior lines of therapy (“phase 3 population”) comprised 137 patients, of whom 46 received NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) and 50 received NP alone (100 mg/m2). NP was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. Results: In this subgroup, intermittent RELA + NP resulted in improvements vs NP alone in PFS (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37‐0.91, log‐rank P=0.0162; median PFS 5.6 vs 3.8 mo); duration of response (DoR; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11‐0.62, log‐rank P=0.0009; median DoR 5.6 vs 3.6 mo); and OS (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31‐0.86, log‐rank P=0.0097; median OS 13.9 vs 12.2 mo). Objective response rates were similar and numerically favored RELA + NP (41.9% vs 38.6%). Conclusions: In addition to the improvements seen in all patients, intermittent RELA + NP improved PFS, OS, and DoR in the “phase 3 population” subgroup. This confirms the potential of intermittent RELA + NP in this patient population, which will be studied further in an upcoming phase 3 trial (ROSELLA, NCT05257408).

N2  -  RATIONALE: Paclitaxel is one of the most widely used human anticancer agents. Paclitaxel has a low degree of solubility and Cremophor EL is typically used as the solubiliser. Cremophor EL is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions that can be life‐threatening. As Paclical® does not contain Cremophor EL, hypersensitivity reactions can be expected to be less. PURPOSE: To study the efficay and safety of two different formulations of paclitaxel, Paclical® and Taxol®.

N2  -  This is a randomized, multicenter international study. Patient are stratified according to Residual tumor diameter([0cm(No residual)] vs. [0cm＜residual＜1cm] vs. [1cm<residual<2cm] vs. [>2 cm]), FIGO stage(StageII vs. III vs. IV) and institution. Patient randomized to one of the treatment arms described below. RegimenI(Standard treatment: dd‐TCiv therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IV infusion once every 3 weeks RegimenII(Study treatment: dd‐TCip therapy): Paclitaxel administered by IV infusion weekly plus concurrent carboplatin administered by IP injection once every 3 weeks The 3‐week period (21 days) is 1 cycle. Protocol treatment basically comprises 6 cycles. IDS is allowed to be performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles of the protocol treatment. In such cases, the protocol treatment must be restarted within 8 weeks after IDS. If IDS is performed, patients can receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment after IDS. If interval debulking surgery (IDS) is performed after 3, 4 or 5 cycles, the patients can receive up to 3 additional cycles of the protocol treatment. A total of 6 to 8 cycles will be repeated. The analysis of efficacy will be performed on all randomized subjects in accordance with the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) principle. In order to assess the robustness of the results, the same analyses will be done using all randomized subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria. The analysis of safety will be performed on all subjects who have received at least one dose of study treatment.

N2  -  A multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase II trial will be conducted. The overall aim of the trial is to investigate whether the addition of saracatinib to weekly paclitaxel improves efficacy, as measured by progression free survival, compared with paclitaxel plus placebo. The trial will also determine toxicity and ascertain whether the combination of paclitaxel plus saracatinib should proceed to a phase III trial. The toxicity data from Study NCT00610714 (D8180C00015) suggests that a small number of patients could experience febrile neutropaenia during their first chemotherapy cycle. To combat this, saracatinib (175 mg OD)/matched placebo will begin 1 week prior to commencement of chemotherapy, and be given continuously until progression. All patients will receive cycles of weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy. One cycle will consist of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest. If there is evidence of on‐going response after 4 cycles, 3 further cycles of saracatinib/placebo plus weekly paclitaxel will be given, unless there is dose‐limiting toxicity or the patient requests to discontinue treatment. If best response is stable disease after 4 cycles, treatment should be discontinued but may continue at the discretion of the Investigator.

N2  -  Eligible: Female adult women (18 to 70 years old) patients, with epithelial ovarian/tubal (FIGO stage IIIC) with a Fagotti modified Laparoscopic Scoring System ≥ 4 who will show a complete or partial clinical response(RECIST 1.1) after 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Carboplatin+Paclitaxel). Duration of recruitment: 2 years. Sample size has been calculated to reach a confidence level of 95% with a power of 80%, considering a 45% and 75% disease‐free survival at 2 years in CRS and CRS+HIPEC group respectively. Sample size will be 47 patients for each group. After CRS, only patients with adequate cytoreduction (CC 0‐1, residual tumor ≤ 2.5mm) will be randomized. Patients with suboptimal cytoreduction (CC 2‐3, residual tumor > 2.5mm) are not suitable for randomization. The drug schedule elected in the current study is Cisplatin (CDDP) (100 mg/m2 of body surface area) + Paclitaxel (175mg/m2 of body surface area). Closed/open technique, as preferred. Duration: 90 minutes. Mean Intra‐abdominal Temperature: 42°C. Primary Endpoint: 2‐years disease‐free survival. Secondary Endpoints: 1‐year, 3‐ and 5‐years disease‐free survival; 1 month, 1‐year, 3‐ and 5‐years overall survival; toxicity induced by HIPEC using the NCI CTC criteria; one month and six months morbidity; duration of operation; return of bowel function; length of hospital stay; return to normal activity; six months and one year QOL, using the SF‐36 v1.0; percentage of patients in both arms completing the scheduled postoperative chemotherapy; Subgroup analysis: PCI ≤ 15; pts. ≤ 40yrs. Main topics of this Study: Focused only on upfront treatment of primary disease. Select platinum‐sensible patients (responders to platinum‐based neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Take advantage of NACT to maximize chances for cytoreduction. Standardized strategy for CRS: radical surgery, associated to any surgical procedure needed to obtain a zero or ≤ 0.25cm residual tumor (peritonectomy, bowel resection, diaphragmatic stripping, gastric resection, etc.). Pelvic and peri‐aortic lymphadenectomy is not chosen as standard procedure, but should warrant adequate staging. Compare only the effect of HIPEC.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if surgical secondary cytoreduction in addition to adjuvant chemotherapy increases the duration of overall survival in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. II. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second‐line and maintenance phases of treatment increases the duration of overall survival relative to second‐line paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second‐line and maintenance phase of treatment increases the duration of progression‐free survival relative to second‐line paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with recurrent platinum sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. II. To prospectively determine the incidence of carboplatin and paclitaxel hypersensitivity in these patients undergoing retreatment with both agents as first recurrence therapy. III. To determine if surgical secondary cytoreduction in addition to adjuvant chemotherapy increases quality of life (QOL) in patients with recurrent platinum‐sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian (FACT‐O) trial outcome index and Rand Short Form (SF)‐36 physical functioning scale. IV. To determine if the addition of bevacizumab to the second‐line and maintenance phases of treatment increases QOL relative to second‐line paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with recurrent platinum‐sensitive epithelial ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube cancer. TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: I. To define molecular and biochemical profiles associated with the duration of progression‐free survival in platinum‐sensitive recurrent ovarian, peritoneal primary or fallopian tube carcinoma treated with combination chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab followed with or without maintenance bevacizumab therapy in the presence or absence of secondary surgical cytoreduction. II. To identify molecular determinants that predict sensitivity or resistance to carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab followed with or without maintenance bevacizumab therapy. III. To bank deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from whole blood for research and evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and measures of clinical outcome including overall survival, progression‐free survival and adverse events. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Patients who are not candidates for surgical cytoreduction (i.e., those for whom complete cytoreduction in the estimation of the investigator is impossible or a medical infirmity precludes exploration and debulking) are eligible to receive chemotherapy after randomization. Patients who are eligible for surgery undergo abdominal exploration with cytoreduction. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours or docetaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. ARM II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in Arm I and bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes on day 1. ARM III: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 8 and carboplatin as in Arm I. ARM IV: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV as in Arm III, bevacizumab IV and carboplatin IV as in Arm II. In all arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with measurable disease achieving a clinical response (CR) receive 6‐8 courses of therapy. Patients with stable disease or partial regression receive a maximum of 8 courses. Patients without measurable lesions as determined by a computed tomography (CT) scan prior to initiating study treatment continue therapy for 6 courses or, if cancer antigen (CA)‐125 normalizes, for 2 courses beyond CA‐125 normalization, whichever is greater. Patients in Arm II then receive a maintenance regimen comprising bevacizumab IV over 30‐90 minutes. Treatment with bevacizumab alone repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for 5 years.

N2  -  Bevacizumab (called also Avastin ®) is a medicine preventing the creation of new blood vessels (a process called "angiogenesis"). This can reduce blood flow of the tumor and then decreasing the contribution of nutriments and oxygen to the cancer cells and prevent the tumor from growing. In various types of cancers, as lung, breast, colorectal and renal cancer, addition of the bevacizumab to chemotherapy allowed to improve the disease outcome. The bevacizumab already benefits from a marketing authorization (MMA) for these various types of cancers. The bevacizumab has also obtained MMA for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in its most frequent histological form (ovarian carcinoma). Clinical trials conducted in this indication demonstrated the importance to pursue the treatment by bevacizumab after the chemotherapy is ended. This anti‐angiogenic medicine is thought to be of a potential interest in sex cords‐ stromal since this tumors are very well vascularized.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: ‐ Compare the efficacy of cisplatin and topotecan followed by paclitaxel and carboplatin vs paclitaxel and carboplatin only, in terms of time to disease progression, in patients with newly diagnosed stage IIB‐IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. ‐ Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens. ‐ Compare the clinical objective response rates in patients with measurable disease at baseline treated with these regimens. ‐ Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. ‐ Compare the CA 125 normalization rates in patients treated with these regimens. ‐ Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to participating center, age (65 years and under vs over 65 years), and pre‐randomization surgery (no debulking vs debulking with macroscopic residual disease less than 1 cm vs debulking with macroscopic residual disease 1 cm or greater vs debulking with no macroscopic residual disease). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. ‐ Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1‐5 of courses 1‐4 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 5‐8. ‐ Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 1‐8. In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Planned interval debulking surgery should occur after course 3 or 4. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; on day 1 of courses 3, 5, and 7; at the end of the last course; and at 3 and 6 months after study treatment completion. Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients (400 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

N2  -  Objectives Single‐agent chemotherapy is a mainstay of platinum‐ resistant ovarian cancer treatment. However, most patients eventually face chemotherapy resistance, which might be driven by endogenous cortisol suppressing apoptotic pathways utilized by chemotherapies. A phase 2 study of nab‐paclitaxel (NP) with/without the glucocorticoid receptor modulator relacorilant (RELA) in patients with ovarian cancer showed improved progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response (DOR) with addition of RELA. We present a post‐hoc subgroup analysis in patients with/without prior bevacizumab. Methods 178 women with recurrent, platinum‐resistant/refractory ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with ≤4 prior lines of chemotherapy (105 with; 73 without prior bevacizumab) were enrolled in a phase 2, open‐label, randomized study (NCT03776812). Data for patients receiving either NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) (n=60) or NP alone (100 mg/m2) (n=60) are reported. Results Baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were generally balanced. While patients without prior bevacizumab were balanced between North America and Europe, 70% of patients who received prior bevacizumab were in Europe. PFS, OS, ORR, and DOR are shown in table 1. Conclusions In this subgroup analysis, patients who had received prior bevacizumab had better PFS, OS, and DOR with intermittent RELA+NP vs NP alone, while ORR was similar across all groups. Numerical improvement in PFS was seen in patients without prior bevacizumab. Prior bevacizumab will be a stratification factor in the phase 3 trial of RELA +NP (ROSELLA, NCT05257408) that is planned to start in mid‐2022.

N2  -  Background: In KEYNOTE‐407, 1L pembro + carboplatin‐(nab)paclitaxel (chemo) significantly improved OS in metastatic sqNSCLC. The poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitor olaparib improved outcomes as maintenance therapy vs placebo in platinum‐sensitive, newly diagnosed BRCA1/BRCA2–mutated (BRCAm) ovarian cancer and relapsed/recurrent BRCAm/BRCA wild‐type ovarian cancer, suggesting efficacy in tumors with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) regardless of BRCAm. High HRD scores in NSCLC suggest potential benefit with olaparib maintenance in pts with NSCLC. KEYLYNK‐008 (NCT03976362) evaluates pembro ± maintenance olaparib after pembro + chemo induction as 1L treatment in pts with metastatic sqNSCLC. Trial design: This randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 study enrolls pts ≥18 y with treatment‐naive histologically/cytologically confirmed metastatic sqNSCLC, with measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), ECOG PS 0/1, and a tumor tissue sample evaluable for PD‐L1. All pts (∼735) receive 4 cycles of pembro 200 mg + carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 or nab‐paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 Q3W. Pts with CR, PR, or SD after cycle 4 (∼566 pts) are randomized 1:1 to pembro 200 mg Q3W (up to 31 cycles) + maintenance olaparib 300 mg or placebo BID, stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), PD‐L1 TPS (<50% vs ≥50%), and response at randomization (CR/PR vs SD). Tumor imaging (RECIST v1.1; 10 total target lesions max, 5/organ) by central review (BICR) occurs at baseline and Q6W up to wk 48, then Q9W until verified PD, start of new anticancer therapy, or study withdrawal. AEs throughout the study up to 30 days (serious AEs, 90 days) after discontinuing treatment are graded by NCI CTCAE v4.0. Primary endpoints are PFS (RECIST v1.1 by BICR) and OS analyzed by Kaplan‐Meier method and stratified log‐rank test, with HRs per stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s tie handling method. Safety and patient reported outcomes are secondary endpoints; ORR and duration of response are exploratory endpoints. Enrollment began on June 28, 2019 at 162 sites in 20 countries.

N2  -  Background: Approximately 70% patients with advanced ovarian cancer have a relapse and ultimately succumb to their disease. Treatment options are limited in this context with an unacceptable low response (less than 20%). Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors presented to date are not very convincing with 10‐15% response because of inadequate immunity. We previously discovered the critical role of manganese in innate immune sensing of tumors by activating STING signaling. This ongoing, randomized, phase II study is to assess STING agonist plus nPP chemotherapy and anti‐PD‐1 antibody sintilimab in platinum‐resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. Methods:Enrolled patients were 2:1 randomizedly assigned to receive nab‐paclitaxel (180‐220mg/m2 ), cisplatin (60‐80mg/m2 ) and sintilimab 200mg per 3 weeks with (cohort 1) or without (cohort 2) inhalable MnCl (0.4mg/kg) daily. Safety was assessed by CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response by MRI or CT every 2 cycles referred to RECIST version 1.1. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Key secondary end points were disease control rate (DCR), progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: 27 patients were enrolled, and 21 were included in efficacy population by the end of Jan. 2020. All enrolled patients were with heavily treated history, median 4 lines of prior therapy, median 19 cycles of multiagent regimens. The addition of MnCl to the combined chemoimmunotherapy did not appear to exacerbate treatment‐related adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs are hematological toxicity (87%), nausea (56%) and vomiting (47%) in both two cohorts. All 14 evaluable patients (14/19) from cohort 1 had an effective control (11 PR [78.6%], 3 SD [21.4%]) . Ten patients (71.4%) achieved PR at the first tumor scan assessment. For 8 cases from cohort 2, 7 were assessable and all showed SD, 4 of whom exhibited SD with enlarged lesions and disease progression after 4‐cycle treatment. Conclusions: MnCl administration induced encouraging objective clinical responses (78.6%) and disease control (100%) in relapsed/refractory ovarian cancer. The combined regimen showed accepted and manageable safety profile.

N2  -  Patients are being asked to be in this study because they have extensive disease small cell lung cancer. All eligible participants who agree to be in the study will receive both abraxane and carboplatin. The researchers want to evaluate the activity and safety of the combination of abraxane and carboplatin, and if this combination can help people with extensive disease small cell lung cancer. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ovarian cancer. It is in a class of drugs known as platinum‐containing compounds. It slows or stops the growth of cancer cells in your body. Carboplatin is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of small‐cell lung cancer, either alone or combined with other anti‐cancer drugs. However, carboplatin given with paclitaxel is a standard or active treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer, non‐small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. Abraxane is a chemotherapy drug that was approved by the FDA to treat metastatic breast cancer after other chemotherapy has already been tried. Abraxane is a new preparation of the active ingredient in the chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel. In a study done in breast cancer patients, Abraxane was compared to paclitaxel. Abraxane has been shown to be more effective than paclitaxel in tumor response and tumor progression, in addition to having fewer side effects than paclitaxel. Abraxane was shown to cause less damage to a person's white blood cells (the cells that fight infection) and cause fewer allergic reactions; however, more patients developed numbness of their hands and feet. Carboplatin and Abraxane are intravenous (IV) medications. Patients will begin treatment with 2 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days) of abraxane and carboplatin. Then there will be a disease assessment at cycles 2 and 4. Patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response will get additional cycles. Patients with progressive disease no will be taken off the study treatment. A maximum of 6 cycles will be given.

N2  -  PURPOSE: Two phase I dose‐escalation studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of the G(2) checkpoint abrogator CBP501, as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with CBP501 alone (D1/D8/D15, q4w, from 0.9 mg/m(2)), or with cisplatin (both on D1, q3w, from 3.6 mg/m(2) CBP501, 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin). Dose escalation proceeded if dose‐limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in 1 or less of 3 to 6 patients; CBP501 dose increments were implemented according to the incidence of toxicity. MTD was determined from DLTs occurring during the first two cycles. RESULTS: In the combination study, the DLT was a histamine‐release syndrome (HRS) occurring 10 to 60 minutes after initiating infusion that was attenuated by prophylaxis comprising dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, and loratadine. The MTD was 25 mg/m(2) CBP501 and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin, with two patients at the highest dose (36.4 mg/m(2) CBP501, 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin) experiencing grade 3 HRS. The only DLT with monotherapy was transient G(3) rise of troponin in one patient. Grade 3 to 4 treatment‐related events were rare. Promising activity was observed with CBP501/cisplatin, mainly in ovarian and mesothelioma patients who had previously progressed on platinum‐containing regimens. Among ovarian cancer patients, low expression of DNA repair proteins was associated with partial response or stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: CBP501 is well tolerated in patients as monotherapy and with cisplatin. At the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), the combination is feasible and HRS manageable with prophylaxis. Evidence of antitumor activity was observed in platinum‐resistant patients.

N2  -  Introduction Single‐agent chemotherapies are commonly used in platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (OC), but outcomes are generally poor. Cortisol, which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), can suppress apoptotic pathways used by chemotherapy. The selective GR modulator relacorilant may reverse cortisol's anti‐apoptotic effects to enhance chemotherapy efficacy. In a phase 2 study in patients with recurrent, platinum‐refractory/resistant OC (NCT03776812), intermittently dosed relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel showed clinically meaningful improvement in progression‐free survival (PFS), duration of response (DoR), and overall survival (OS) without increased side effect burden vs. nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. The ROSELLA study aims to confirm these findings in a larger patient population. Methods ROSELLA (NCT05257408) is a randomized, phase 3, 2‐arm, open‐label study of relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel vs. nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy. Approximately 360 women with platinum‐resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have received 1‐3 prior systemic anticancer therapies, including prior bevacizumab, and ≥1 platinum‐based therapy are being enrolled. Patients with primary platinumrefractory disease are excluded. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to relacorilant (150 mg the day before, of, and after nabpaclitaxel) + nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) or nab‐paclitaxel monotherapy (100 mg/m2); stratified by prior lines of therapy (1 vs >1) and region of world (North America vs. Europe vs. rest of world). Nab‐paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. The primary endpoint is PFS by blinded independent central review. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints include OS, PFS by investigator assessment, objective response rate, best overall response, DoR, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, patient‐reported outcomes, and quality of life. Current Trial Status Currently enrolling.

N2  -  Background: Chemotherapy resistance is a major concern in the treatment of advanced platinum‐resistant and platinum‐refractory ovarian cancer. One mechanism of resistance is driven by cortisol, which can suppress the apoptotic pathways that chemotherapy agents rely upon, eg, suppression of BCL2 and FOXO3a pathways. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism may reverse the anti‐apoptotic effects of cortisol, thereby restoring the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. Relacorilant is a selective GR modulator that has shown promise in overcoming resistance when combined with taxanes (particularly nab‐paclitaxel) in preclinical models (Greenstein & Hunt 2021) and early‐phase clinical studies (Munster et al. 2019) in various solid tumors. A randomized, controlled phase 2 study of relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel found clinically meaningful improvements in progression‐free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) without increased side effect burden in patients with recurrent, platinum‐refractory and platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (Colombo et al. 2021). The aim of this phase 3 study is to confirm these phase 2 findings in a larger patient population. Methods: ROSELLA (EudraCT 2022‐000662‐18, NCT pending) is a phase 3, randomized, 2‐ arm, open‐label, multicenter study of relacorilant + nab‐paclitaxel compared to investigator's choice of chemotherapy agents in patients with confirmed high‐grade serous epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. The trial is being conducted at multiple sites in North America and Europe and has a planned enrollment of 360 patients. Patients are randomized 1:1 to either relacorilant (150 mg the day before, day of, and day after nab‐paclitaxel infusion) + nab‐paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, topotecan, or nab‐paclitaxel). Randomization is stratified by prior lines of therapy (1 vs > 1), region of world (North America vs Europe), and prior bevacizumab (yes/no). Adult female patients with platinum‐resistant disease (progression within 6 months of completion of platinum‐containing therapy), excluding patients with primary platinum refractory disease, who have received 1‐3 lines of prior systemic anticancer therapy and at least 1 prior line of platinum therapy are being enrolled. Life expectancy ≥3 months, adequate organ function, and ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 are required. The primary study endpoint is PFS by blinded independent central review. Key secondary endpoints include overall survival, PFS by investigator, overall response rate, best overall response, DOR, clinical benefit rate, safety, quality of life, CA‐125, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics.

N2  -  Background: Cortisol contributes to chemotherapy resistance by suppressing apoptotic pathways that cytotoxic agents utilize. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulation with relacorilant (RELA) reverses the anti‐apoptotic effects of cortisol and restores the efficacy of cytotoxic agents. We report overall survival (OS) results from a randomized, controlled phase 2 study of RELA + nab‐paclitaxel (NP) compared to NP only in patients with ovarian cancer (NCT03776812). The primary analysis showed improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and a favorable safety profile with intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only, despite overrepresentation of primary platinum‐refractory patients in the intermittent RELA + NP (n = 7) vs the NP‐only arm (n = 1). Methods: A phase 2, open‐label, randomized, 3‐arm study of 2 RELA dosing schedules + NP compared with NP only was performed. 178 women with recurrent, platinum‐resistant/refractory, high‐grade serous or endometrioid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma with ≤4 prior chemotherapeutic regimens were enrolled. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to: a) NP (80 mg/m2) + intermittent RELA (150 mg QD the day before, of, and after NP) (n = 60); b) NP (80 mg/m2) + continuous RELA (100 mg QD) (n = 58); or c) NP only (100 mg/m2) (n = 60). NP was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28‐day cycle. The primary endpoint was PFS; OS was a secondary endpoint. OS data for the intermittent and continuous arms were compared to NP only using a 2‐sided log‐rank test, stratified by presence of ascites and relapse within 6 months on previous taxane, at a 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment. Results: At the pre‐defined OS analysis (128 OS events), hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.67 (95% CI [0.43, 1.03], P= 0.066) and 0.85 (95% CI [0.56, 1.29], P= 0.447) for intermittent and continuous RELA + NP vs NP only. Median OS was 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]), 11.3 (95% CI [7.5, 16.4]), and 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months in the intermittent RELA + NP, continuous RELA + NP, and NP‐only arms. In the subgroup of patients without primary platinum‐refractory disease, a statistically significant improvement in OS was observed with HR 0.63 (95% CI [0.39, 0.99], P= 0.045) and median OS of 13.9 (95% CI [11.1, 18.4]) vs 12.2 (95% CI [7.7, 15.3]) months for intermittent RELA + NP vs NP only. Conclusions: In addition to the improved PFS and DOR observed at the primary analysis, the OS analysis confirmed the survival benefit of intermittent RELA + NP compared to NP only, particularly in patients who were not primary platinum refractory. A phase 3 trial evaluating intermittent RELA + NP vs investigator's choice of chemotherapy in patients without primary platinum‐refractory disease is ongoing (NCT05257408).

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To estimate the progression‐free survival (PFS) hazard ratio of trametinib compared to that of "commercially available therapies" consisting of one of five commercially available agents in women with recurrent low‐grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum previously treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the nature, frequency and maximum degree of toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4 for each treatment arm. II. To determine the quality of life, as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Ovarian (FACT‐O). IIa. To compare trametinib to the control arm with regard to patients' self‐reported acute (up to post‐cycle 6) quality of life as measured by the FACT‐O‐Trial Outcome Index (TOI). IIb. To compare trametinib to the control arm with regard to patients' self‐reported acute (up to post‐cycle 6) neurotoxicity as measured by the FACT‐Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)‐Neurotoxicity (NTX). III. To estimate the objective response rate (RR) of patients in each treatment arm. IV. To test whether high expression of pERK, as quantified by immunohistochemistry (IHC), is associated with better prognosis (RR or PFS) among patients receiving the randomized treatment. V. To test whether genetic changes associated with MAPK pathway activation (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MEK, ERBB2 or NF1) are associated with improved prognosis (RR or PFS) among patients receiving the randomized treatment. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. ARM A: Patients receive clinician's choice of either letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1‐28, tamoxifen citrate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1‐28, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (PLD) IV over 1 hour on day 1, or topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients developing progressive disease may cross over to Arm B. ARM B: Patients receive trametinib PO QD on days 1‐28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To examine if letrozole monotherapy/maintenance (L/L) is non‐inferior to intravenous (IV) paclitaxel/carboplatin and maintenance letrozole (CT/L) with respect to progression‐free survival (PFS) in women with stage II‐IV primary low‐grade serous carcinoma of the ovary or peritoneum after primary surgical cytoreduction. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To compare the nature, frequency and maximum degree of toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0 for each treatment arm. II. To compare the relative frequency of objective tumor response in those with measurable disease after cytoreductive surgery for each treatment arm. III. To compare overall survival for each treatment arm. IV. To compare the CT/L and L/L arms with respect to patients' adherence to letrozole therapy as measured by pill counts. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. Patients then receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood collection and tumor biopsy during screening as well as medical imaging throughout the study. ARM II: Patients receive letrozole PO QD. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. Patients then receive letrozole orally PO QD in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as maintenance therapy. Patients undergo blood collection and tumor biopsy during screening as well as medical imaging throughout the study. After completion of study treatment/intervention, patients/participants are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.

N2  -  Carcinoma cervix is the 2nd most common malignancy among females and about 86% of this burden occurs in developing countries. India accounts for 27% of world cervical cancer burden; and most of them are of locally advanced stage ie stage IIA to IVA. Significant development in radiation techniques and addition of cisplatin based chemotherapy to radiation schedule has led to improved survival but still it is far from satisfactory with 20 to 25% patients failing locally while 10 to 20% patients fail at distant sites. Novel techniques are required to improve this dismal rate. Thus investigators intended to use combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin, considering that paclitaxel is a taxane which has shown good efficacy in other solid tumors such as ovary, lung and breast; it has also shown radiosensitizing effect in cervical cancer cell lines and it has also been shown to be effective in phase III trials with cisplatin in metastatic and recurrent carcinoma cervix.

N2  -  Background: Pre‐clinical and clinical data indicate that glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonism may enhance/restore chemotherapy sensitivity. This is the first randomized, controlled study to explore the efficacy and safety of relacorilant (RELA), a selective GR modulator, in combination w/ nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐pac) compared to nab‐pac alone. Methods: Women w/ recurrent platinum‐resistant/refractory high grade serous or endometroid epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer or ovarian carcinosarcoma w/ measurable or non‐measurable disease and up to 4 chemotherapeutic regimens were 1:1:1 randomized to: ‐CONTINUOUS 100mg RELA daily (w/discretionary escalation to 150mg) + 80mg/m2 nab‐pac on days 1, 8, and 15 of a q28‐day schedule; or ‐INTERMITTENT 150mg RELA the day before, of, and after 80mg/m2 nab‐pac on days 1, 8, and 15, of a q28‐day schedule; or ‐COMPARATOR,100mg/m2 nab‐pac on days 1, 8, and 15, of a q28‐day schedule. A lower nab‐pac dose was used with RELA because RELA inhibits the metabolism of nab‐pac. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) determined by the investigator per RECIST 1.1. Results: 178 women were randomized. At median follow‐up of 11.07 mos, the INTERMITTENT regimen significantly improved median PFS compared to nab‐pac alone (HR, 0.66, 95%CI 0.44‐0.98, log‐rank test p=0.038). While ORR was similar, Duration of Response (DoR) was significantly improved (HR 0.36, 95% 0.16‐0.77, p=0.006) in the INTERMITTENT regimen vs. nab‐pac alone. Overall survival will be assessed at maturity. Most common grade ≥3 adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy. [Formula presented] Conclusions: INTERMITTENT RELA + nab‐pac improved PFS and had a favorable safety profile in recurrent platinum‐resistant and/or platinum‐refractory ovarian cancer patients.

The study team will analyze the data entered in eCRF to assess this outcome. The willingness to participants to be randomised to a SoC option will be assessed at the registration into the study] The willingness to participate in the randomised cohort or the non‐randomised cohorts among those invited.[This will be collected as part of the clinical outcomes data extracted from the electronic case report form (eCRF). This will be assessed for each participant at the registration into the study; ] SECONDARY OUTCOME: Adherence to Assigned SoC[This will be collected as part of the clinical outcomes data extracted from the medical record by the clinician. This will be measured for each participant by clinician assessment of treatment adherence at 6 and 12 months (if available) post participant consent.] The feasibility of collecting required baseline and outcome data. This is a composite outcome, feasibility of collecting required baseline data (i.e. completeness of required baseline data) is relevant to determining the outcome. ; ; This will be measured for each participant by the completeness of data available in their medical record to determine the outcome (including treatment success, treatment side effects) for their particular medical condition. As discussed in UAT meetings, specific fields will be deemed mandatory and the completeness of these fields only will be used to assess feasibility.[This will be measured for each participant by the completeness of data available in their medical record to determine the outcome (including treatment success, treatment side effects) for their particular medical condition. This will be assessed at Baseline, 6 months and 12 months post participant consent.] INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Adults, aged 18 years and older. 2.

N2  -  Purpose: AB160 is a 160‐nm nano‐immunoconjugate consisting of nab‐paclitaxel (ABX) nanoparticles noncovalently coated with bevacizumab (BEV) for targeted delivery into tissues expressing high levels of VEGF. Preclinical data showed that AB160 resulted in greater tumor targeting and tumor inhibition compared with sequential treatment with ABX then BEV. Given individual drug activity, we investigated the safety and toxicity of AB160 in patients with gynecologic cancers. Patients and Methods: A 3+3 phase I trial was conducted with three potential dose levels in patients with previously treated endometrial, cervical, and platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer to ascertain the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). AB160 was administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28‐day cycle (ABX 75–175 mg/m2, BEV 30–70 mg/m2). Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. Results: No dose‐limiting toxicities (DLT) were seen among the three dose levels tested. Grade 3/4 toxicities included neutropenia, thromboembolic events, and leukopenia. DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2) was chosen as the RP2D. Seven of the 19 patients with measurable disease (36.8%) had confirmed partial responses (95% confidence interval, 16.3%–61.6%). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that AB160 allowed 50% higher paclitaxel dosing and that paclitaxel clearance mirrored that of therapeutic antibodies. Conclusions: The safety profile and clinical activity of AB160 supports further clinical testing in patients with gynecologic cancers; the RP2D is DL2 (ABX 150 mg/m2, BEV 60 mg/m2).

N2  -  Background: Gemcitabine (gem) with nab‐paclitaxel (nab‐p) is known to have antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile. The addition of bevacizumab (bev) to nab‐paclitaxel has also been found to enhance nab‐paclitaxel cytotoxicity. Methods: We therefore performed a modified 3+3 dose escalation study with 15 dose levels of fixed dose gem 1000 mg/m2 IV (day 1, 8, 15) and escalating doses of nab‐p IV (day 1,8, 15) and bev IV (day 1,15) every 28 days. The study design allowed for the possibility of multiple MTDs. Correlative studies on VEGF polymorphism and response were planned. (NCT01113476). Results: 103 patients (45 male) with advanced cancers were enrolled (19 ovarian, 18 pancreatic, and 18 gastroesophageal (GE) cancers among the most common). All patients were ECOG PS 0‐2, median age was 60 years (range 17‐85), and 51 patients (50%) were gem refractory with a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. 3 DLTs were observed during dose escalation ‐ one with nab‐p 50 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 (grade 3 dysphagia, dehydration), one with nab‐p 75 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 (grade 3 cellulitis) and one with nab‐p 150 mg/m2 and bev 5 mg/m2 (grade 3 bacteremia, hypotension). 2 DLTs were observed among the 13 patients in the nab‐p 100 mg/m2 and bev 5 mg/m2 expansion cohort (one grade 3 diarrhea, one grade 3 fatigue) and 1 DLT among the 12 patients in the nab‐p 75 mg/m2 and bev 10 mg/m2 expansion cohort (grade 3 rectal bleed). Dose escalation up to nab‐p 125 mg/m2 and bev 15 mg/m2 was well tolerated with no MTD. One patient with gem refractory peritoneal papillary carcinoma achieved a complete response, 13 patients (13%) had partial responses (PR), and 54 patients (52%) had prolonged stable disease (pSD) ≥ 12 weeks. 4 patients achieving PR and 26 patients with pSD were previously gem refractory. 3/6 (50%) small cell cancers achieved PR and all 6 of these patients had tumor shrinkage of at least 25%. 4/19 (21%) ovarian cancers achieved PR, 3/18 (17%) GE cancers achieved PR, and 1/18 (6%) pancreatic cancers achieved PR. Conclusions: The combination of gem 1000 mg/m2 , nab‐p 125 mg/m2 and bev 15 mg/m2 is safe, well‐tolerated, and has activity even at lower doses in advanced malignancies, including gem refractory tumors. Correlative VEGF polymorphism studies are ongoing.

N2  -  Background: Prognostic nomograms have been developed in various cancers, including ovarian, breast, and gastrointestinal; however, there is limited information on nomograms in MPC. The large, phase 3 MPACT study of nab‐P + Gem vs Gem alone for the treatment of MPC provides a robust database for the development of a nomogram to predict OS using baseline patient variables. Methods: A multivariable Cox model was created from MPACT data using factors that were significantly predictive of OS in univariable analysis or considered clinically important (stepwise selection to remain in model). From the Cox model, a nomogram was derived that assigned points equal to the weighted sum of relative significance of each variable. The nomogram was internally validated using bootstrapping, a concordance index (c‐index), and calibration plots. Results: Data from all 861 pts were used. Seven of the 34 considered variables were retained in the multivariable analysis (Table; all factors significant at the P< 0.01 level, except for analgesic use [P = 0.07]). The resulting nomogram was able to distinguish low (n = 216), medium (n = 430), and high (n = 215) risk groups (c‐index: 0.69; CI: 0.67‐0.71) with median OS values of 12.9, 8.2, and 3.7 months, respectively. Calibration curves showed that the nomogram's predicted probabilities were mostly consistent with observed probabilities for 6‐, 9‐, and 12‐month OS. Conclusions: Treatment arm, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), albumin level, sum of longest tumor diameters (SLD), and presence of liver metastasis were the key predictors of OS. This nomogram, which will be presented in visual format in the final presentation, may help physicians and pts make informed treatment decisions. (Table Presented).

N2  -  Background: TNBC patients with homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumors have significantly higher pathologic complete response (pCR, ypTO/is ypNO) rates when treated with platinum‐based chemotherapy. TILs are prognostic and predictive of chemotherapy benefit in TNBC. Interestingly, recent data suggests that HR deficient TNBCs and BRCA1/2 mutant ovarian cancers may be enriched for immune cell infiltration. Thus, we performed a pooled analysis of 5 phase II studies that included patients with TNBC treated with neoadjuvant platinum‐based chemotherapy to evaluate the association of TILs with HR deficiency status and tumor BRCA1/2 mutation status. Methods: 166 patients with TNBC and known HR deficiency status from the following clinical trials were available for analysis: PrECOG 0105 (N=72), NCT00580333 (N=32), NCT01372579 (N=26), TBCRC 008 (N=18) and NCT00148694 (N=18). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens included 1) carboplatin, gemcitabine, iniparib, 2) cisplatin with or without bevacizumab 3) carboplatin, eribulin, 4) carboplatin, nab‐paclitaxel, with or without vorinostat. HR deficiency status was defined as a high HRD score (42 or higher) and/or presence of a BRCA1/2 tumor mutation (tBRCA). Digitized pre‐treatment core biopsy H&E sections were reviewed and scored by two blinded expert breast cancer pathologists using the international TIL working group guidelines. The density (%) of both intratumoral TILs (iTILs) and stromal TILs (sTILs) was recorded by deciles (n=122 thus far, additional cases to be included in final analysis). Results: Among 122 patients, pCR was achieved in 36 patients (29.5%) and 71 tumors (58.2%) were HR deficient. In total, 24 patients (19.7%) patients had a deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation. Among all tumors, iTIL and sTIL median densities were 0% (range 0‐20) and 10% (range 0‐80), respectively, and were not statistically different in HR deficient versus non‐deficient tumors (iTIL p=0.746; sTIL p=0.159). The same absent association was observed for tBRCA mutation status (iTIL p=0.607; sTIL p=0.315) and binary HRD score (iTIL p=0.879; sTIL p=0.364). Updated results with additional cases scored for TILs will be reported at time of presentation. Additional analyses assessing the relationship between TILs and pCR/residual cancer burden adjusting for HRD status and other clinical variables will also be included at the time of presentation. Conclusion: Several previous studies have reported that TILs are significantly associated with response to standard chemotherapy regimens when given in the neoadjuvant setting. Measures of genomic instability and DNA repair deficiency, including HRD, have been shown to be robust predictors of response to chemotherapy, including platinum containing regimens. It is unclear if TILs will be predictive in a similarly robust way for response to platinum‐containing regimens. Results of this study suggest TIL density and HR deficiency status may be independent and non‐overlapping.

N2  -  1.1 Self‐expandable metallic stent (SEMS) Self‐expandable metallic stent (SEMS) placement is a well‐established and widely used treatment for patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. This palliative technique prolongs survival, shortens hospital stay, and improves quality of life in patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction. Unfortunately, SEMS have the disadvantage of occlusion over time because of tumor ingrowth (tumor invasion through the metal wire mesh of the stent) or overgrowth (tumor growing at the end of the stent), and mucosal hyperplasia as a consequence of chronic irritation. The occlusion rate of SEMS varies from 10% to 50% of cases of malignant biliary obstruction. 6‐9 Duration of SEMS patency is important for patients with a short life‐expectancy because quality of life and cost‐effectiveness are mainly determined by stent occlusion. Previous studies have suggested that covered metallic stents may prevent tumor ingrowth and reduce the occlusion rate, but tumor overgrowth is still problematic. 11 12 13 Therefore, there is a dire need for a metallic stent that prevents both tumor ingrowth and overgrowth. 1.2. Paclitaxel Paclitaxel is a potent antineoplastic drug extracted from the bark of the pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) and has been utilized for the therapy for ovarian, breast, lung, and other cancers. This potent drug exerts its pharmacological effects through a unique mechanism. Paclitaxel causes formation of numerous decentralized and unorganized microtubules and enhances the assembly of extraordinarily stable and dysfunctional microtubules. In addition, it inhibits activation processes like activation of protein kinases or release of transcription factors. In addition, paclitaxel has several pharmacokinetic characteristics that make it well suited for locoregional cancer therapy. It has rapid cellular uptake and a first pass effect because of its extremely lipophilic character and long lasting action over a broad concentration range. Furthermore, paclitaxel has antiangiogenic and antimetastatic properties. The efficacy in dose dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of human gallbladder epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells makes paclitaxel a very promising substance for local drug delivery to reduce the proliferative and migratory components that are involved in tumor growth. This inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on the cell lines had served as the basis to develop drug‐eluting stents for malignant biliary strictures. 1.3. Paclitaxel‐eluting covered metallic stent Covering the stent with chemotherapeutic agent, such as paclitaxel, should give protection against tumor ingrowth, overgrowth, or both resulting in increased patency, longer survival rates and increased remaining quality of life. There had been only few studies on the effect of a paclitaxel‐eluting covered metallic stent on animal bile duct. In a study on porcine bile duct, the degree of histologic changes, which included inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous reactions, corresponded to the amount of paclitaxel incorporated within the stent. The degree of inflammatory change was more severe in porcine bile duct in contact with the stent with 20% concentration (% wt/v) of paclitaxel than the stent with 10% concentration. There was no case of transmural necrosis and perforation. The results of this particular study had served as a basis for further research. In our preliminary study, no significant complications such as perforation or stent migration have occurred in either DDS or CS group. Therefore, it can be suggested that this paclitaxel‐eluting SEMS is safe in the normal canine bile duct.

N2  -  Germline mutation status of BRCA1/2 and other breast cancer predisposition genes as predictive and prognostic biomarker: Results of the GeparX study (GeparX‐BRCA) Background: There is accumulating evidence that the RANK/RANKL signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in breast tumorigenesis, particularly in the development of BRCA1‐mutated tumors. Targeting the RANK pathway has been shown to attenuate breast cancer (BC) proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Studies using bone modifying agents as adjuvant therapy showed reduced rates of bone metastases and improved BC survival, as well as prevention of treatment‐induced skeletal events. The GeparX clinical trial assessed the use of denosumab in patients with primary BC as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for its ability to enhance pathological complete response (pCR) rate and improve outcome. The trial randomized 780 patients twice to a total of 4 treatment groups (to receive or not receive denosumab; to receive nab‐paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks or days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, both followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, 90/600 mg/m2 every 2 weeks/every 3 weeks according to the investigator's choice). Carboplatin was given in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC), and trastuzumab biosimilar ABP980 plus pertuzumab was given in human epidermal growth factor‐2‐positive (HER2+) BC. Overall, the pCR (ypT0 ypN0) rate was 41% with denosumab vs 43% without; nab‐paclitaxel at a dosage of 125 mg/m2 weekly resulted in a significantly higher pCR rate of 45% vs 39% with a dosage of 125 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Research question: Does the germline mutation status of BRCA1/2 and other BC predisposition genes affect treatment outcome in the GeparX study? Methods: Genetic germline analyses assessing pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 and 16 other BC predisposition genes were performed at the Center for Familial Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Cologne, Germany; 767 patients were included in this secondary investigation (308 TNBC, 306 HER2‐/hormone receptor positive [HR+], 153 HER2+). Findings: Germline BRCA1/2 mutations were present in 91/767 patients (11.9%), with a higher mutation prevalence in TNBC (50/308, 16.2%) and HER2‐/HR+ BC (37/306, 12.1%), and a low mutation prevalence in HER2+ BC (4/153, 2.6%). Overall, the pCR rate (ypT0 ypN0) was elevated in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs non‐carriers (49.5% vs 41.1%, respectively; overall: OR 1.40, 95% CI 0.90‐2.17; TNBC: OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67‐2.32; HER2‐/HR+: OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.86‐3.88). Highest pCR rates were observed in TNBC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs non‐carriers (60% vs. 54.7%, respectively). Highest pCR rate differences were observed HER2‐/HR+ BC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers vs noncarriers (32.4% vs. 20.8%, respectively). Regarding treatment arms, both BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non‐carriers benefitted most from nab‐paclitaxel at a dosage of 125 mg/m2 weekly vs 125 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks (BRCA1/2 mutation carriers: 55.3% vs 43.2%, respectively; OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.71‐3.73; non‐carriers: 43.7% vs 38.6%, respectively; OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91‐1.68). No beneficial effect was observed for denosumab vs no denosumab (51.1% vs 47.8% for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, respectively; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.50‐2.60; 40.3% vs 41.9% for non‐carriers, respectively; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69‐1.27). Of the 617 BRCA1/2‐negative patients, 59 patients carried mutations in other BC predisposition genes which did not predict therapy response compared to patients without any mutation. Conclusions: Irrespective of the treatment arm, higher pCR rates were observed in BRCA1/2 mutations carriers vs non‐carriers. Both BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and noncarriers benefitted most from weekly nab‐paclitaxel. No pronounced effect was observed for denosumab in either group.

Cabozantinib‐s‐malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether cabozantinib‐s‐malate or paclitaxel is more effective at treating patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cavity cancer.

N2  -  This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to residual disease 1 cm or less vs more than 1cm, stage II vs III vs IV, and histology (clear cell or mucinous vs. serous or others). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for 6‐9 cycles. Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour days 1, 8, and 15 and carboplatin IV over 60 minutes on day 1 for 6‐9 cycles. In both arms, cycles repeat 6 cycles every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Additional 3 cycles are given if clinical partial or complete response after 6 cycles. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total 600 patients (300 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 3 years. Assuming median progression‐free survivals of 16 months and 21 months and a recruitment period of 3 years this can be achieved by recruiting 600 patients designed to have 80 % detect to a difference between the two arms at the two‐sided 5% level of statistical significance.

N2  -  Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplasm in women in Brazil and in the world and up to 15% of all cases diagnosed correspond to the triple negative subtype. Triple negative breast cancer affects young women with germline mutations in BRCA 1/2 genes. Giving the lack of target therapies to date, there is no consensus regarding the most effective treatment for this subgroup of tumors. Although evidence shows that triple negative breast cancer is highly sensitive to chemotherapy when compared to other breast tumors, there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that patients with triple negative breast cancer and mutation in BRCA1 / 2 genes have higher chemosensitivity to neoadjuvant therapy. The investigator proposes a prospective, randomized, open‐label, phase II study, evaluating the rate of complete pathologic response, disease‐free survival, overall survival and prognostic evaluation of BRCA1 / 2 mutation status in women with triple negative breast cancer submitted to sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on anthracycline and taxane, with or without carboplatin.

N2  -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK‐3475) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced stage (measurable stage III or IVA), stage IVB and recurrent endometrial cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the nature, frequency and degree of toxicity as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for each treatment arm. II. To evaluate blinded independent central review (BICR) assessed or investigator assessed objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 by treatment arm and by mismatch repair (MMR) immunohistochemistry (IHC) status in patients who enter the study with measurable disease. III. To evaluate BICR assessed or investigator assessed duration of response (DOR) by treatment arm and by MMR IHC status in patients who enter the study with measurable disease. IV. To evaluate the effect of pembrolizumab (MK‐3475) on overall survival (OS) in patients with mismatch repair protein proficient (pMMR) or mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). V. To determine whether the addition of pembrolizumab (MK‐3475) to standard combination chemotherapy is associated with improved patient reported physical function as measured with the Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)‐physical function scale (short form), quality of life as measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) ‐ Endometrial Trial Outcome Index (En TOI) and worsened fatigue as measured with the PROMIS‐Fatigue scale (short form) in the pMMR patients. VI. To determine concordance between institutional MMR immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing and centralized MMR IHC. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: I. To explore the correlation between patient‐reported physical function as measured with the PROMIS‐physical function scale (short form) and quality of life as measure with the FACT‐En TOI. II. To explore whether the addition of pembrolizumab (MK‐3475) to standard combination chemotherapy is associated with self‐reported neurotoxicity as measured with the FACT/Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (GOG‐Ntx) subscale (short) and the extent to which patients differ on their self‐reported bother from side effects of cancer therapy in the pMMR patients. III. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK‐3475) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced stage (measurable stage III or IVA), stage IVB and recurrent endometrial cancer by Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD‐L1) IHC (positive versus [vs] negative). IV. To assess the association between PD‐L1 IHC (positive vs negative) and mismatch repair status (pMMR and dMMR). OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM I: COMBINATION PHASE: Patients receive placebo intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 of each cycle, and carboplatin IV over 30‐60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR) who still have measurable disease may continue treatment for up to a total 10 cycles (if deemed necessary by the treating physician) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive placebo IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. On February 6, 2023, all patient treatment assignments were unblinded. Patients randomized to Arm I will not receive additional placebo infusions. ARM II: COMBINATION PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 of each cycle, and carboplatin IV over 30‐60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with SD or PR who still have measurable disease may continue treatment for up to a total of 10 cycles (if deemed necessary by the treating physician) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography (CT) scan throughout the study. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

N2  -  OBJECTIVES: I. Compare survival and progression‐free survival in patients with stage III endometrial carcinoma treated with tumor volume‐directed pelvic radiotherapy with or without paraaortic radiotherapy followed by cisplatin and doxorubicin with or without paclitaxel. II. Compare short and long‐term toxic effects of these treatment regimens in this patient population. OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy field (pelvic vs extended field). Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients receive tumor volume‐directed pelvic radiotherapy with or without paraaortic nodal radiotherapy once daily for 5 consecutive days for up to 16 weeks after surgery. Within 8 weeks of completing radiotherapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 chemotherapy treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive filgrastim (G‐CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or pegfilgrastim on days 2‐11. Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 2, and G‐CSF SC or pegfilgrastim on days 3‐12. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 614 patients (307 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5.2 years.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab (P) is an anti‐PD‐1 antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) on T‐cells and PD‐L1 and PD‐L2 on tumour cells. A phase Ib trial of P plus chemotherapy was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy. METHODS: Patients with advanced, metastatic solid tumours were enrolled onto one of six treatment arms. Pembrolizumab was given: with gemcitabine (G), G+docetaxel (D), G+nab‐paclitaxel (NP), G+vinorelbine (V) or irinotecan (I) until progression or toxicity, or with liposomal doxorubicin (LD) for up to 15 cycles, progression or toxicity. Safety monitoring and response assessments were conducted. RESULTS: Forty‐nine patients were enrolled and treated. The most common adverse events were transaminitis, cytopenias, rash, diarrhoea, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Arm 2 was closed due to poor accrual. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined for Arms 1, 3a, 4, 5 and 6. There were eight partial responses across multiple tumour types. CONCLUSIONS: Standard dose P can be safely combined with G, G+NP, G+V, I and LD. Efficacy was observed in multiple tumour types and evaluation to determine if response and duration of response are more robust than what would be expected for chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone requires further validation.
